 about Australia
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, wouldn't your clients have an adequate remedy under Australian law in 
Australia, in the Australian court system? MR
 DUBBS: We might or we might not
 But that is not determinative
 JUSTICE ALITO: that they do not
 Let's assume that on the facts of this case they could not prevail under Australian law in 
the Australian court system
 Then what United States MR
 DUBBS: JUSTICE ALITO: -- that should override that? MR
 DUBBS: There is a strong United States interest
 It's on two levels
 The first strong United States -- United States interest deals with the conduct 
at issue here, namely the conduct in Florida by 
HomeSide
 This was the sixth largest mortgage service provider in the United States
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If we had only HomeSide's conduct, nothing else, there wouldn't be any violation 
of (b); is that right? MR
 DUBBS: We do not agree with that, Your Honor
 We believe that they made a representation by  
 creating the false numbers, or otherwise it's within the 
scope of the statute
 What they did is create a JUSTICE GINSBURG: But nothing has happened
 Suppose it had been caught by the Australian bank, and 
they didn't act on it? MR
 DUBBS: Your -- Your Honor, that goes to a different element of the cause of action
 That doesn't go to the scope of the statute
 That goes to how the private cause of action is enforced
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, I concede your argument that a big component of this fraud was what 
went on in Florida, but it needed to be disclosed to the 
public
 It needed to be put out there
 And that wasn't done in Florida by the Florida defendants
 MR
 DUBBS: It was done in Australia and we can prove that
 And -- the point is we are not -- all we are proving through doing that is the effects of the 
fraud in Florida
 To use Professor Beale's example, where you have poison candy in one jurisdiction, that 
poison candy is sent to another jurisdiction, and in the 
first jurisdiction there is a law that says "thou shalt 
not make poison candy;" through the exercise of 
legislative jurisdiction that statute in the first 
jurisdiction is appropriate, and both jurisdictions have  
 an interest in that
 Now, if we are in the poison candy jurisdiction and we are bringing a case about poison 
candy, if the statute in addition says, "you have to 
show some harm from the poison candy," indeed you might 
as a matter of proof have to show effects from that 
other forum
 But that's different than regulating conduct in the second forum or anything else in the 
second forum
 That is simply looking at the statute or the legal prescription against making poison candy
 And we say section (b) is like the poison candy statute
 JUSTICE ALITO: JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's -- I would like you to follow that up specifically
 That is, in my mind the difficult issue in this case is not the 
jurisdictional issue under principles of international 
law
 It's the question of the scope of the statute
 And there the things against you are three
 One is Professor Sachs's argument, which I would like to know 
your answer to
 The second is in Judge Friendly's two opinions
 The first opinion -- the second one, rather, Bersch, he says if you had a foreign exchange and 
foreign plaintiffs as -- and there was no foreign 
plaintiff, the security issued over a foreign exchange,  
 even if that fraud takes place totally in the United 
States, the statute wouldn't cover it
 That's Friendly, which started this
 And the third thing is what he says in Leasco
 He says: We cannot see any sound reason for not taking your position, at least for the plaintiffs 
who are Americans
 Okay? Now, France, Britain and Australia have filed briefs in this case giving what they consider very 
sound reasons, which are reasons that Judge Friendly 
never considered
 And those three reasons, as we know, is they point to a number of conflicts, that if you win, 
how that will interfere with their efforts to regulate 
their own securities markets, right? That's all one question: Professor Sachs, Friendly in Bersch, and Friendly in Leasco
 But that's what I'd like to hear your answer to
 MR
 DUBBS: I will try to keep the subparts in mind
 Why don't we start from the end and try to work backwards
 Perhaps one of the most important parts of the record is the Solicitor General's view that as a 
general matter -- and I will get to the specifics; I'm 
not ducking that
 But as a general matter the enforcement of the securities laws, unlike the antitrust 
laws, has not historically and today they do not believe  
 runs -- raises a substantial risk of interstate 
conflict
 Now, as to the specific briefs that Your Honor referenced, if we look at those briefs and we look 
at those compared to what happened in Hartford Fire, 
those briefs -- and let's focus on Australia's for the 
moment because that's the country we are talking about
 
Australia's brief essentially says they have a 
regulatory system that may -- that we may or may not 
have been able to litigate this cause of action in 
Australia, but let's assume that we could
 They are not saying -- they did not say in that brief that there was some fundamental conflict, 
like the plurality found in Hartford Fire; nor did they 
say that there was the kind of conflict that comes up in 
the application of (h) of the Restatement, which 
Justice Scalia looked to in his opinion in Hartford 
Fire
 So there is not the kind of conflict that leads necessarily -- necessarily -- to not reasonably applying 
the statute
 The reason there's not is that because, one, there is not a rule in Australia that one has to abide 
by and a rule in the United States that one has to abide 
by that are contradictory
 At most, what you have is you have a clear rule in the United States that says  
 thou shalt not commit fraud in Florida through either 
the Florida through either -- for or in interstate 
commerce, the mails or through an exchange
 And on the other side of the equation what you have is maybe they 
could have brought suit over here and we have a robust 
regulatory system and a robust litigation system; more 
power to them
 But that doesn't mean -- saying that, that doesn't mean that the first State where the poison candy 
was made suddenly has no interest in that
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but -- but Australia says: Look, it's up to us to decide whether there has been a misrepresentation, point one; and whether it's 
been relied upon by the -- by the plaintiffs, point two
 
And we should be able to decide that and we don't want 
it decided by a foreign court
 You are talking about a misrepresentation, if there was one in this case, made in Australia to 
Australian purchasers; it ought to be up to us to decide 
that issue; and here you are dragging the American 
courts into it
 MR
 DUBBS: Well, let me deal with the dragging in part in a minute, because that's 
subliminally very important to the case
 But let me address the direct question
 He  
 Australians may believe that, but the question is was 
there a misrepresentation both in the United States and 
possibly in Australia? If there was in Australia, that's for the Australians
 That's dealing with the effects of eating the poison candy
 But we say a JUSTICE SCALIA: Not to these plaintiffs
 MR
 DUBBS: JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you have to join the misrepresentation to the plaintiff
 MR
 DUBBS: JUSTICE SCALIA: The only misrepresentation to these plaintiffs was made in Australia by an 
Australian company
 MR
 DUBBS: There are two ways to connect the fraud to the plaintiffs
 The one is the "in connection with" requirement that deals with conduct, 
which we meet, and this Court has construed very broadly 
in Dabit, in Zandford and any other number of cases
 
That's number one
 Number two, assuming that the scope of the statute is broad enough to cover the conduct in Florida, 
we then get to the second question, which is the 
reasonableness of the application of the statute, and 
without a conflict, we would then look at -- to the  
 interest of the United States and compare them to the 
Australians
 And the Australians can say, we can -- you know, we can go after eating that poison candy
 And we say, fine, if you want to, that's great
 But that doesn't mean we can't go after the act of poisoning the 
candy in Florida
 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- that isn't the issue
 The -- the -- the issue for the Australians is: We want to determine whether there has been a 
misrepresentation or not
 MR
 DUBBS: JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't want the determination of whether there has been a 
misrepresentation on the Australian exchange and whether 
Australian purchasers relied upon that misrepresentation 
to be determined by an American court
 MR
 DUBBS: And we say more power to you, you can decide that question
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not if it's decided here, unless you want to say, the Australian court to say, the 
United States taking this case is so outrageous that we 
will not respect its judgment
 And that's a factor, too
 It's -- what conflict of laws is all about is you have two jurisdictions, both with an interest in 
applying their own law, but sometimes one defers to the  
 other
 MR
 DUBBS: That's correct, Your Honor
 And the question is should there be deferral in this case
 
And we say if you apply the standards of -- of Hartford 
Fire or the standards of the Restatement, you don't end 
up in deferral
 You end up in prosecution of the Section (b) cause of action in Florida
 And you do that for a couple of different reasons
 First, you look at the magnitude of the conduct in Florida, the size of this
 This is a $
 billion writedown in a portfolio
 You have a portfolio of $ billion worth of mortgages sitting 
down in Jacksonville, Florida
 Those are all mortgages on American homes,  million American homes
 So, this is not just Australia, Australia, Australia
 That's what's in the portfolio and that's what's being 
misrepresented
 And when they doctor the numbers and send them to Australia, it's a misrepresentation of 
that
 In addition, you have the overarching consideration of is it appropriate to sue National 
Australia Bank in the United States at -- at a -- at a 
more abstract level? And the answer to that, we submit, is yes
 They have invested -- if you care to look, it's on the SA- and SA- of the supplemental appendix,  
 they have invest -- they have $ billion worth of 
assets here
 They own a bank in Michigan, they have a huge trading operation on Park Avenue that trades 
billions of dollars in derivatives every day
 This is not the situation -- this is not the stereotype of a 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those derivatives are not at issue here, right? MR
 DUBBS: CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I presume -- I'm sorry, go ahead
 MR
 DUBBS: They are only at issue in the following sense, which is that the position on the 
mortgage servicing rights was hedged in New York
 When the hedge came undone, there were losses in New York on 
the other side of the hedge
 That goes to the point of were there any affects in the United States, because 
there seems to be some confusion on that
 There were some effects here from the hedge
 There were some effects on -- in the ADR market, but we are not -- we 
JUSTICE GINSBURG: MR
 DUBBS: -- disputing that most of the effects were over there
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Dubbs, Morrison, the  
 first-named plaintiff, was a derivative holder
 MR
 DUBBS: No, Your Honor
 He was the holder of an ADR
 The derivatives come in because they are the activity in New York that is the other side of 
the transaction
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But do you have -- you have two classes of plaintiffs, one the Australians, who 
bought their shares in Australia; then you have 
Morrison, who has an ADR, and who is dismissed because 
he wasn't able to show damages
 MR
 DUBBS: That's true
 There -- there are no Americans left
 This is strictly Australians
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what U
S
 investor was harmed? MR
 DUBBS: The -- the question is, were there effects on the U
S
 market? There were U
S
 investors who were, in all likelihood, harmed but none 
have stepped forward with respect to ADR holders
 But if the question in the abstract is were there economic 
effects from this transaction in the United States, the 
answer is -- is yes, there were fallout from -- on -- on 
the derivative side, which is the other side -- which 
was the other side, in effect, the short side of what 
the long position was, which was $ billion worth of 
mortgages in Florida that what is -- what the portfolio  
 consisted of
 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you -- do you want to finish? MR
 DUBBS: No, Your Honor
 JUSTICE BREYER: Then -- I mean, I can see
 I will give you all that
 That isn't what is bothering me
 I think you are right so far as what you have argued
 But the part that I think is most difficult is why I -- I shorthand referred to Professor Sachs' 
article
 MR
 DUBBS: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: Because what Australia is actually saying is what we don't like about -- about the 
American system, you know, their -- their common 
criticisms of class actions
 We say, first of all, the American rule means even if our companies here are 
right, that they are going to have to pay their legal 
fees
 We don't like punitive damages
 We don't like that we have the opt-out
 And these are all our citizens, and we don't want to subject our companies on 
our exchange to that stuff
 Now, fine, they have a reason on their side
 Then Professor Sachs says: Read the statute, because they argue -- it was never intended to cover that kind 
of stuff
 Now, that's what I would like you to address  
 specifically
 MR
 DUBBS: Well, it was -- there are two issues
 The statute was intended to cover that kind of stuff if the antecedent of "stuff" is fraud in Florida
 
Now, that's a separate question from how we deal with 
the private right of action in these circumstances
 Now, let's back up
 The general criticism of these cases is that they are gotcha cases
 You put in a little bit and all of a sudden the private bar 
comes and attacks you
 I mean, that's the stereotype
 Well, the stereotype is wrong and it's important to 
understand why the stereotype is wrong
 Because if all you have is a very modest investment in the ADR market, 
 percent like my friends from NAB, those cases get 
bounced at the beginning on personal jurisdiction as 
they did in the district of New Jersey in SCORS and the 
Novagold case
 We are not aware of any case where if all you've got is that little toehold that you stay in
 
You get bounced by -- on personal jurisdiction
 And to pick up on the discussion that I was having with Justice Ginsburg, we thought that in 
addition to that, if the Court wanted to send signals 
with respect to these kinds of cases, if you put, as you 
can, Sinochem at the beginning of the train, even more 
of these cases if they are fallacious are going to be  
 screened out of the system
 So, the point is that we can all tell our Australian friends that there are very rigid safeguards 
in place so that this horror story in reality doesn't 
happen and it has not been proven to happen
 It is an attractive myth, but it hasn't happened
 Those cases go out and they go out early
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure that it happens in advance of considerable discovery
 I -- I --I would agree that the judge can confine discovery to 
forum non conveniens or for personal jurisdiction, but 
in -- in these cases one of the things we are really 
talking about is the burden of discovery
 That's the cost of litigation
 You know that
 MR
 DUBBS: I do know that and let me answer briefly, because I want to reserve my time for rebuttal
 
I disagree with your fundamental observation, Justice 
Kennedy
 These cases are paid attention to by the district judges and they go out early
 They go out early on personal jurisdiction; there is not a lot of 
discovery on that
 They go out early -- if Sinochem gets applied faithfully, it would go out early on that 
if there is a close question
 And then you go to the (b)()
 And pursuant to the Private Securities  
 Litigation Reform Act, one of the purposes of that is no 
discovery, no discovery until after the motion to 
dismiss is decided
 So it is not true that there is a lot of discovery, there is a lot of transaction costs, before 
we know the answer to one of the threshold questions, 
which is: Should this case be in our system or not? That can be handled and it is being handled on a daily 
basis, notwithstanding, you know, some stereotypes
 Now, my final point with respect to Professor Sachs' articles and some of the other articles 
is they in effect -- if they advocate a rule, which many 
of them do, which it should be limited to exchanges, 
that goes back to my threshold point of the scope of the 
statute
 And it takes an eraser to the statute and it says: It's only exchanges; it's not in connection with foreign or interstate commerce or through the mails; 
it's limited, contrary to the express words of the 
statute, in a way that the statutory construction we 
don't believe can stand it
 Now, there are other legitimate ways of cabining the private cause of action
 But that -- if you are faithful to the statute, we submit that is not 
one of them
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,  
 Mr
 Dubbs
 Mr
 Conway
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE T
 CONWAY, III, ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS MR
 CONWAY: Thank you, Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed for two reasons
 First, Petitioners have identified nothing in the text of section (b) that overcomes the 
presumption against extraterritoriality or the Charming 
Betsy Rule
 The statutes should thus be construed not to apply to transactions and shares of foreign issuers 
on foreign exchanges
 Second, unlike the rights of action that this Court has addressed in other extraterritoriality 
cases, the section (b) right is purely implied
 
Congress didn't intend for this right of action to exist 
even domestically, let alone extraterritorially
 Given the threat that the section (b} implied right presents to the sovereign authority of 
other nations, as reflected in the amicus briefs of 
Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and the 
diplomatic note from the Swiss government, the Court 
should construe the implied right not to extend to  
 claims of purchasers and sellers of securities of 
foreign issuers on foreign markets
 The two clear statement rules are, obviously, the presumption against extraterritoriality 
and the Charming Betsy Rule require that the Congress
 
Both require an affirmative intention of the Congress 
clearly expressed before the statute can be applied to 
apply to foreign transactions or to, you know, matters 
that it infringes on the sovereign authority on other 
nations
 My friends don't identify anything in the statute that comets even close to a clear statement
 
They principally rely on the definition of "interstate 
commerce," but as this court said in Aramco, that kind 
of boilerplate simply doesn't suffice to overcome the 
presumption against extraterritoriality
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what is your test for whether -- whether it's being applied internationally or 
not? MR
 CONWAY: Well, our test is that, at a minimum, section b should be held not to apply to 
transactions involving shares of foreign issues on 
foreign exchanges, because that presents the greatest 
danger of conflict of foreign law, particularly in the 
context of the modern section b implied right, which  
 has the fraud on the market presumption and holds 
issuers liable, as here for example, for two and a half 
years of trading, all on an Australian exchange
 That is massive transfer of wealth that the Petitioners here 

basically, it's a direct form of market regulation that 
Australia has not seen fit to impose upon itself
 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you on that point: Supposing the class of plaintiffs included a group of Americans who were shareholders of the 
Australian bank and who -- but who purchased their stock 
over the Australian exchange
 MR
 CONWAY: We would -- well, we would submit that that rule should be the same
 That they should -- they should not also, they should not be 
allowed to sue under section b
 They -- they -- you know, those people chose to purchase on the Australian 
exchange
 And in terms of the threat to international comity, I think it would be probably take -- I don't 
think other countries would take nicely to a -- to a 
rule of law that would allow Americans, essentially, to 
bring their rules, their law, their remedies, fraud, on 
JUSTICE BREYER: Give me reasons for it
 The strongest one for it, the strongest example against  
 you it seems to me, is Judge Friendly's example
 
Schmidt, a citizen of Germany, flies to New York and 
meets Jones in the hotel
 And Jones says, I have a bridge I want to sell you
 Look out the window
 Say, Do you own the Brooklyn Bridge? Yes
 And that's a lie
 Here's what you do
 You invest in buying shares of my company sold on the German exchange
 Okay? MR
 CONWAY: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: Conduct took place in the United States, a terrible fraud
 This is contrary to fraud and, says, I think, Judge Friendly and others, it 
should apply at least where Schmidt is an American 
citizen and Professor Sachs says no, not even then
 What do you do with that case? The fraud took place totally here
 MR
 CONWAY: Well, I disagree with that, Your Honor, I think the fraud is carried out when the 
transaction occurs in a foreign country
 But I do agree JUSTICE BREYER: Sign the paper here in New York
 MR
 CONWAY: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: Sign the paper, right here, and give me the money, because I have an urgent 
appointment
  
 MR
 CONWAY: Yes, sir
 (Laughter
) MR
 CONWAY: That's a much different case, obviously, than the fraud in the market case that we 
have here
 But Your Honor, yes, that is a stronger circumstance
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but your position and hers is: That's no more a valid claim than this one or any other one we dream up
 That's why it's a pure example, and I want to know how you feel about it
 
MR
 CONWAY: Well, I think that -- I think the problem is, in order to have that conduct swept 
within the statute, you have to ignore the language and 
the presumption against extraterritoriality
 If you go to petition appendix , that has its text in section b, and section b refers to the 
use or employment of any manipulative device or 
contrivance, and it's in connection with the purchase or 
sale of any security registered on a national securities 
exchange
 JUSTICE BREYER: Or any other
 Or -- read the next word
 MR
 CONWAY: That's correct
 Any security not so registered
 And this Court has held -- it has 
 held in cases like Aramco, American Banana, Moritson, 
that the words "any" and "every," words of universal 
scope, do not -- do not mean that these -- that 
something referred to is anything, anywhere else in the 
world
 And for example, the Court is small against the United States
 In the case where the presumption of extraterritoriality didn't really apply the court held 
that in a statute, you normally assume that things being 
referred to are thing in the United States
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the government going to tell us that its test, which differs from the foreign 
exchange test, is based on considerations like those 
suggested in Justice Breyer's Brooklyn Bridge 
hypothetical? MR
 CONWAY: I think they do
 I think they look to -- I think their view is that the statute is 
vague and you have to do essentially what Judge Friendly 
did and the Seventh Circuit did for many years, is you 
have to make do and decide what the best rule is
 And with respect to the government, that is essentially 
doing what this Court has said under the presumption 
against extraterritoriality the Court shouldn't do
 
That's essentially legislating, trying to figure out 
what Congress would have done, had "a particular 
 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would the limitations on discovery give you substantial protection were we to 
adopt the government's test or say the foreign exchange 
test with the subset exceptions for the -- that takes 
account of the government's test? MR
 CONWAY: Your Honor, I think the problem with the government's test and with the Second Circuit's 
test, is that it would still allow the application of U
S
 law in a manner that would infringe the sovereign authority of other nations
 And I can give an example
 There was a case over the summer that the Petitioners attached to their 
first supplemental brief on the petition for certiorari
 
And it's a case called PC shifts
 And it's an interesting case because it involved a Canadian company 
with headquarters in Britain and most of whose shares 
traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange
 And what happened there was that the CEO spent time in Florida -- it was a shipping company
 
We spent time in, Miami running the show from Miami
 
And the court of appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in a 
ruling that it held was consistent with the Second 
Circuit decision in this case held that nonetheless, the 
application of U
S
 law could be applied to transactions 
 of -- of foreign plaintiffs on the Toronto Stock 
Exchange
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it a consideration that MR
 CONWAY: Yes, discovery alone
 Yes, Your Honor
 Discovery alone
 I think the French brief, for example, points that out
 I think a number of the brief -- there have been blocking statutes that have 
been enacted by various countries because of the -- what 
they deem to be the offensive scope of discovery
 In France, you are really only allowed to obtain evidence 
that is actually admissible in trial
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure how you interpret the language that you -- that you just read, 
when you say to use or employ in connection with the 
purchase or sale of any security registered on the 
National Security Exchange or any security not so 
registered
 Now, is it your point that in order to avoid an international extension of it, it should apply only 
to securities? What? MR
 CONWAY: JUSTICE SCALIA: Securities purchased and sold in the United States? Is that it? MR
 CONWAY: That -- that's correct, Your  
 Honor
 I think that's a fair reading of the statute
 And this Court is required, under both the presumption 
against extraterritoriality under its decision and the 
Charming Betsy Rule to interpret a statute, take the 
permissible construction of the statute that is least 
likely to result in an extraterritorial of the law
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Purchased -- purchased or sold? MR
 CONWAY: Purposed or sold, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if it's not -- what if it -- what if the fraud produces neither a purchase or a 
sale but induces somebody to hold on to stock that 
otherwise the person would dispose of? MR
 CONWAY: Well, I -- I don't know that that would state a claim, a private claim under Blue 
Chip Stamps
 And any -- and if the share or the securities are held abroad, if it's a foreign security, 
and I think the liability in that hypothetical -- I'm 
assuming that if it's a foreign security held by a 
foreigner -- that really would be something that would 
be subject to foreign law, whether or not Australia 
wants to represent -- recognize holder claims of the 
sort that this Court rejected in Blue Chip Stamps
 
That's a question for Australia to decide
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under these same  
 facts if you had -- altering according to the 
hypothetical, you had U
S
 plaintiffs who purchased 
National Australia Bank ADRs on the New York exchange, 
you don't doubt that they can sue, do you? MR
 CONWAY: No, and in fact, we told the district court, we did not move to defense on 
extraterritoriality grounds the claims of Mr
 Morrison, 
who inexplicably is still here
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right
 MR
 CONWAY: We argued that Mr
 Morrison's claims should be defeated on the grounds that he had no 
damages, which was an absolutely ironclad calculation 
best based on a -- on a provision of the PSLRA, and we 
also argued that all of the claims should be dismissed 
for failure to plead fraud with the requisite 
particularity of the PSLRA
 But we certainly do not dispute that when a company like ours registers shares on -- registers 
shares with the SEC, ADRs with its SEC and lists them on 
a New York stock exchange, it's subjecting itself to New 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And presumably that would impose the same discovery on the bank as the 
Sudanese case
 MR
 CONWAY: It could, Your Honor, that's  
 absolutely true
 But on the other hand, I mean, a lot of the other aspects of -- of this litigation, which 
this Court has, you know, noted that is potentially 
highly vexatious, I mean, that is only 
 percent of 
the flow -- of the total equity securities of the -- the 
National Australia Bank
 So the dangers of -- of a threat of -- of coerced settlements is much, much less
 It's a much, much easier case to deal with if -- if -- if you are only dealing with the ADRs
 Now if another company decides to list half its equity on 
the New York Stock Exchange, well, it can -- it makes 
the determination for itself, how much of this kind of 
litigation it wants to subject itself to
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose there were litigation with substantial allegations of wire fraud 
violations as predicate for RICO violations, and the 
case begins to proceed, and then there is a second cause 
of action under the securities law
 Would -- would the fact that there is going to be discovery and substantial 
litigation in the -- in the United States courts be a 
factor in retaining the -- the securities violation in 
this suit? Or would the test be just the same in your view? MR
 CONWAY: I think the -- I think you have to take each statute separately
 You have to look at  
 what the language of the statute says, whether it -- it 
admits fault in an extraterritorial reading, and whether 
that -- frankly whether that extraterritorial reading is 
required or compelled
 If there is any other possible construction, as the Court said in -- in Charming Betsy, 
the court is required to accept that construction, 
accept the construction that doesn't result in 
JUSTICE GINSBURG: On the -- on the extraterritorial presumption against it, your colleague 
on the other side tells us that in all the cases where 
the presumption applied, all of the conduct was 
someplace else, and they give the Aramco case and say 
MR
 CONWAY: JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and everything happened outside the country
 MR
 CONWAY: JUSTICE GINSBURG: Here, I mean, you have to concede that a component of the alleged fraud occurred 
in Florida
 MR
 CONWAY: We do concede that some of the conduct that ultimately, you know, led -- in a but-for 
causal relationship to what happened in the Australia 
occurred in the United States, but that's true in a lot  
 of other cases
 For example, Aramco, Mr
 Boureslan was hired in Houston
 So was the cook in Foley Brothers v
 Filardo
 And in Microsoft v
 AT&T, basically all of the conduct, the relevant conduct was in the United States, 
because what the -- what section (f) proscribed in 
Microsoft was the shipment -- the supply in or from the 
United States of a component of a patented invention
 And what this Court held in Microsoft was that notwithstanding AT&T's argument that, "Hey, the 
presumption against extraterritoriality doesn't really 
apply because this is just regulating the supply in and 
from the United States," this Court held that the 
presumption against extraterritoriality applied because 
what would happen is, a single act of supply would 
result in a springboard for liability each time a -- a 
disk was put into a computer abroad
 And that is exactly analogous to the circumstances in this case, where what we -- what 
happened was some -- some allegedly false information 
was transmitted to Australia; it was then republished in 


allegedly, as they would have it -- resulted in 

purchased a share of stock of the National Australia  
 Bank on the Australian securities exchange
 And so that is exactly analogous to -- to Microsoft v
 AT&T
 Again, another point I think that's relevant is the, section  of the Exchange Act
 Congress did not make a clear statement in section 
 It did make clear statements in section 
 Section (a) addresses transactions on foreign exchanges
 Section  as a whole is entitled Foreign Exchanges, and section (a) 
makes it -- makes -- gives the SEC power to promulgate 
regulations that -- that apply to brokers and dealers 
who effect transactions of securities on foreign 
exchanges, if those transactions are transactions of 
shares of shares of U
S
 issuers
 And that's at -- for reference, the text of section  is at page  of the law professors' brief
 
And section (b) also, it says that the SEC can 

of businesses -- securities that are abroad, but only to 
the extent the SEC finds it necessary to prevent evasion 
of the Act domestically
 And so Congress made two clear statements in section 
 It did not make any clear statement in section 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, is that your only point? Or is your point also that you wouldn't need  
 MR
 CONWAY: JUSTICE SCALIA: -- were read as broadly
 MR
 CONWAY: That's absolutely right
 The reading -- my friend's reading of section  would 
render section (b) -- I mean the reading of section 
(b) would render section  superfluous
 And there are other provisions of -- that are in the Exchange Act 
where Congress has made clear statements to show that it 
can make clear statements
 Section A which immediately follows section , is the Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act
 So Congress -- if Congress -- if there is a loophole, and that's what this Court said in Microsoft v
 AT&T; if there is some kind of loophole that presents some kind of a problem, that Congress needs to fix, 
Congress can do it
 Congress can do it with a clear statement
 In sum, Your Honors, countries -- nations of the world do things differently
 They -- they -- they have different rules of liability
 We see in the amicus briefs different rules of materiality, different rules 
of disclosure
 And some rely on -- on public enforcement more than others
 The French rely on l'action publique, as  
 they say; and some nations approach ours in their 
generosity to plaintiffs
 Australia allows opt-out class actions; so does Canada
 Canada allows opt-out class actions; it dispenses with, for example, the proof 
of reliance, it dispenses with scienter in some cases
 
Yet it -- it does all that, but it restricts liability 
JUSTICE BREYER: How does it hurt the other countries if what we would say on their reading of this 
is, Congress has said, "Look, if some terribly bad 
conduct happens in the United States; they lie through 
their teeth; and you, whoever you are in the world, who 
buys some shares and as a result you are hurt, we will 
give you a remedy
 Come to us" -- now, how does that hurt Australia? MR
 CONWAY: JUSTICE BREYER: Or France or England or any of these others? MR
 CONWAY: Exactly the same way this Court said it hurts in Empagran
 In Empagran this Court noted that -- that a reading of the rule that would allow -- a 
reading of the FTAIA that would have allowed foreign 
plaintiffs to come and sue for -- for foreign vitamins 
transaction in a foreign country would essentially allow 
plaintiffs to avoid the -- the narrower rules of the  
 liability and the narrower remedies that other nations 
provide
 And that is exactly true here, where, you know, for example, Australia does not permit 
fraud-on-the-market class actions
 it doesn't recognize the fraud-on-the-market 
presumption
 And as I said, for example, Canada restricts these actions, it has generous liability rules and 
allows opt-out class actions, but it says -- it caps 
damages at  percent of an issuer's market 
capitalization or $ million, whichever is greater
 And so that's the -- that is the problem
 It's not just substance but it's remedy
 Other nations want to do things in different ways; they should be 
allowed to
 What is going on here is essentially a --Brandeising -- experiment a global scale
 And that's a good thing
 It's a good thing because it enables countries to judge for themselves what kind of rules 
they want to have for people who buy shares on their own 
exchanges
 And to apply section (b) it cases like this would cut that experiment short
 It would amount to exactly the soft of legal imperialism that this Court 
rejected, rightly, in Empagran
 The Court should reject it here as well and it should affirm the judgment of the  
 court of appeals
 I thank you
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr
 Conway
 Mr
 Roberts
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D
 ROBERTS, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS MR
 ROBERTS: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents two distinct questions: First whether the fraud alleged by Petitioners violated 
Section b; and second, whether Petitioners may bring a 
private action
 In our view, the alleged fraud violated Section b, because significant conduct material to the 
fraud's success occurred in the United States
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There are -- there are a lot of moving parts in that test
 You know, significant conduct, material, you require it to have a 
direct causal relationship
 Doesn't the complication of that kind of defeat the whole purpose? MR
 ROBERTS: No, Your Honor, we don't think so
 In terms of the -- of the direct cause part, which it will be -- the significant limit on private actions,  
 as this case illustrates, the district courts even 
accepting the allegations in the plaintiff's complaint 
will often be able to dismiss the suit on the pleading 
for its failure to satisfy that test
 It's not a CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's only for the private companies? MR
 ROBERTS: That's right
 And in terms of the other test, again, I don't think it's that 
complicated
 The -- the significance part of it is essentially trying to assess the amount of the conduct 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: what if significant elements of the fraud occur in four 
different countries? MR
 ROBERTS: If -- if -- the critical question is whether there's significant conduct here 
that's material to the broad success
 And the reason for that is if Section b didn't cover that kind of 
conduct, then that would risk allowing the United States 
to become a base for orchestrating securities frauds for 
export
 It would allow thing like masterminds in the United States engineering international boiler room 
schemes in which they direct agents in foreign countries 
to make fraudulent representations that victimize  
 investors
 JUSTICE BREYER: So it's not as easy to apply this, you think? Now, on your theory, I guess Schmidt is in Germany and we have our Brooklyn Bridge
 
Okay, now wait
 What happens is he calls Schmidt on the telephone, Jones, and he says I own the Brooklyn Bridge
 
Actual, right, direct? Under your test, correct? MR
 ROBERTS: Schmidt is in Germany? JUSTICE BREYER: Schmidt is in Germany
 He calls him up
 MR
 ROBERTS: The defrauder is in Germany? JUSTICE BREYER: All -- everything -- you have to assume he's going to buy the thing on the 
exchange in Germany but the fraud is in Brooklyn
 He is lying about -- he doesn't really own the Brooklyn 
Bridge
 So he calls Schmidt
 I am interested in -- he calls Schmidt
 Causation, that's what your last pages of your brief, focus on that
 He calls him and he lies to him
 Actual
 MR
 ROBERTS: I'm sorry, Your Honor, can I ask you if everybody is in Germany? JUSTICE BREYER: No
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE BREYER: Go back to my Brooklyn Bridge example
 Everything is hatched in your boiler  
 room
 MR
 ROBERTS: Okay
 JUSTICE BREYER: And they communicate the lie by calling Schmidt in Berlin on the telephone, 
directly
 MR
 ROBERTS: Okay
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Schmidt is the German
 He's in Germany
 (Laughter
) MR
 ROBERTS: I'm sorry
 JUSTICE BREYER: MR
 ROBERTS: The question is, is there JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm focusing on the last pages of your brief
 Where you turn this whole thing on the directness of the causation
 MR
 ROBERTS: That's right
 And the SEC would be able to take action if there is significant 
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm accepting that for the moment
 What's bothering me, taking off from what the Chief Justice said, is the feasibility of your test
 
Your test, it seems to me on causation, would say that 
when you phone Schmidt and lie to him, he can sue
 But when you phone your parent company, knowing that they  
 will put it in the prospectus and Schmidt will read it, 
you can't sue
 And then what occurs to me is suppose you phoned a reporter, or suppose you phoned your parent 
company and you knew they would tell a reporter
 I'm focusing on the practicality of your causation test
 MR
 ROBERTS: If the conduct is directed or JUSTICE BREYER: Correct
 MR
 ROBERTS: -- then it would -- then the direct causation test would be -- would be met
 The critical question is, is the conduct in the United 
JUSTICE BREYER: You think that's the question here? You think the question is whether this really took place in Florida? I didn't think that was the question
 MR
 ROBERTS: In terms of a private plaintiff suing, in our view, the question is whether 
the United States' conduct has a close enough connection 
JUSTICE BREYER: Let's skip -- skip my question because other people may ask
 JUSTICE ALITO: If the plaintiffs in this case had clearly alleged in their complaint that nobody  
 in Australia reviewed the numbers that were sent from 
Florida to any degree, they just directly copied them, 
some low-level clerk directly copied them, would the 
direct cause test be met? MR
 ROBERTS: Yes, if the action was just ministerial over overseas, it would -- it would be met
 
Again, the critical question, in our view, under the 
direct cause test is, was there culpable conduct in the 
United States that is directly responsible for the 
plaintiff's injury? JUSTICE GINSBURG: JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then you give no weight to the fact that it was on the Australian 
exchange? MR
 ROBERTS: The -- the fact that the transaction happens on the Australian exchange is not 
dispositive, because if -- if somebody in the United 
States is directly -- is -- is executing the fraud -- if 
it turned on just a transaction on the Australian 
exchange, then a domestic investor could be injured by a 
fraud that is hatched entirely here that is executed 
entirely here, and he is tricked into executing a 
transaction on an overseas exchange
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Roberts, because your time is running out, there is a basic question here
  
 You are asking us to make a distinction between what the 
SEC can sue for and what a private party can sue for
 
Congress did that with respect to aiders and abettors
 Is there any other instance in which we have made a distinction, yes, the SEC has a claim but the 
private litigant doesn't? MR
 ROBERTS: Yes, the -- the -- the private litigants are -- have numerous elements that they have 
to show that the SEC doesn't have to show: Reliance, loss, loss causation
 All of those go to the causal link between the injury and -- and the fraud
 And we think that the direct injury requirement is an 
appropriate application of those more general causation 
requirements in the context of transnational fraud
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I am frankly less concerned with your -- your test for the private cause of action, 
the direct cause test -- I -- I guess I could work with 
that -- than I am with your test for -- for the 
jurisdiction of the -- of the SEC, which is sort of a 
totality of the circumstances test
 It doesn't seem to me that's an appropriate test for a jurisdictional 
question
 You don't want to spend time litigating the totality of the circumstances
 MR
 ROBERTS: We don't think it's a -- a jurisdictional question in the sense of the subject  
 matter jurisdiction, Your Honor
 It's a -- a test about the scope of the statutory coverage
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, okay
 MR
 ROBERTS: And it's true that bright line rules -- it's true that bright line rules are easier to 
administer, but the -- there is a danger in bright line 
rules for fraud prohibitions because they can provide a 
road map for evasion of the statute
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any indication that our friends around the world are 
comfortable with your test? MR
 ROBERTS: Well, the briefs that have been filed by Australia and United Kingdom and France 
are limited to the private right of action
 They base their -- what they want to do is to limit the private 
rights
 And I think the United Kingdom brief specifically says that -- it thinks that SEC action 
could be appropriate here, and that's a reason why, if 
the Court adopts the -- a limit on the private actions, 
that it need not -- it need not be concerned about the 
possibility that -- that fraud would be launched in the 
United States or directed in the United States and it 
couldn't be addressed
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess we don't have to say anything about -- about what the government can do,  
 do we? MR
 ROBERTS: No, Your Honor
 And we would certainly prefer that you decided the case solely on the 
private right of action if the alternative for a holding 
substantive prohibitions didn't apply here
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr
 Roberts, you urge deference to the SEC's interpretation in 
administrative adjudications? MR
 ROBERTS: Yes
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have anything other than those two proceedings over the last  years? MR
 ROBERTS: Those are the two administrative adjudications
 The SEC's administrative adjudicatory authority is limited to people involved in 
the securities industry, and a lot of these frauds that 
happen are -- don't involve people that are registered 
broker/dealers and the like
 There are numerous Civil Actions that the SEC has brought where it has taken the 
same approach
 The SEC v
 Berger case that we cite in our brief is one of them
 I can name some others
 There is SEC v
 Wolfson, which is a case that's in the district 
court in Utah, and SEC v
 Shay in -- in the southern 
district of New York
 SEC v
 Banger in the northern district of Illinois
 Those involve international  
 boiler-room schemes of the kind I was alluding to 
before, where masterminds in the United States basically 
direct agents that they have got in countries like 
Thailand or Spain to -- to make false statements and 
engage in high-pressure selling to target investors in 
other countries
 Sometimes they induce them to engage in transactions in still other countries
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr
 Roberts
 Mr
 Dubbs, you have three minutes remaining
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A
 DUBBS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS MR
 DUBBS: Thank you, Your Honor
 Let me begin with Justice Alito's question, and I promise to 
get back to Judge Friendly and the Brooklyn Bridge
 As to -- we have alleged that in -- that effectively, ministerial activities did occur here
 The Second Circuit held, interpreting our complaint, that 
the numbers were mechanically incorporated
 That's as close to ministerial as you get
 We used, in the complaint, the were "adopted
" We said that they were asleep at the wheel
 The meaning is the same, but the -- there were no 
checkpoints
 The checkpoints are illusory
 If there was a checkpoint, the guard was asleep at the  
 checkpoint, and the MSR number went right through the 
checkpoint
 Those are the allegations, and we should be able to stick with the allegations
 Now, turning to the statute, my colleague indicated that the language with respect to foreign and 
interstate commerce and so on, based on the Aramco 
decision, was boilerplate
 That's wrong
 In this statute, those specific statutory approaches towards 
stopping fraud are in the substance of the statute
 
They are not in the jurisdictional statute
 That's important
 That's why that's different
 As to the Leasco example and Bersch example, what Leasco shows is a long chain of causation, because 
Leasco involved an American, not a foreigner, which was 
very important under Judge Friendly's typology
 And in Leasco, you have this extended line of causation 
beginning with representations in the United States 
about a friendly, tender offer
 Then there was a phone call, maybe in London, maybe in the United States, and 
then there was a command by Saul Steinberg to his 
investment bankers: Go into the London Stock Exchange and start to buy
 That extended line of causation would not pass muster under the direct cause test
 The direct cause test as this Court is using it in the RICO area  
 State law? I mean, it's -- it's commonplace for the Federal law to look to State law on issues of ownership
 
And, in fact, if there is this doctrine of equitable 
ownership on the part of the attorney, what right does 
the government have to do the setoff? MR
 YANG: Well, that might be true if we were relying on a common law offset
 But in this context, Congress has directed that all Federal 
payments, unless there is an exception -- and there is 
no exception in this case -- are to be offset before 
payment, any payment, to the debtor
 So in this case, Congress has effectively established a priority scheme 
whereby when a debtor owes a delinquent valid debt to 
the United States and the United States owes an 
offsetting obligation to that individual, Congress has 
provided that no Federal funds shall be paid to the 
individual and instead that the debt -- the government's 
debt shall be offset against the debt that the --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the client is bankrupt? What happens then? MR
 YANG: The same rule would apply
 No Federal payment would -- well -- I believe that the same 
rule would apply
 I've not carefully studied the bankruptcy provisions, and I hate to venture into a very 
complicated area to give you something definitive
 But  
 my belief is that, based on the very clear text of 
section  of Title , which was amended by the Debt 
Collection Improvement Act, that no payment shall be --
even in bankruptcy, the payment goes to the -- has 
to go to the debtor first, and then it goes to the estate 
-- that no payment shall be made from the Treasury and 
instead an administrative offset shall be undertaken to 
collect the government's debt
 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there a way for the lawyer -- a lawyer sees that his client has a good case 
against the government, and thinks he can get an EAGA 
fee, so he says to the client: I'd like to represent you and I can get paid for this
 But the client says: There are a lot of debts I owe the government
 Now, is there any way they can work it out so he can get the representation? MR
 YANG: Well, sure
 There™s --JUSTICE BREYER: What? MR
 YANG: As we indicated in our brief, there's several things that can be done
 First, the attorney can determine whether there is in fact a debt 
which is eligible for offset, and that can be done by 
asking the Treasury with a valid Privacy Act waiver from 
the client
 If that is the case, the client retains the right, which Congress expressly codified in section  
 , the right to enter into a repayment agreement
 If that is done, there will be no offset, and the repayment 
agreement is largely governed by the Federal claims 
collections standards, which are codified at  C
F
R
  
to , and those -- those provisions provide in section 

, for instance, that installments shall -- should 
bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and 
the debtor's ability to pay
 And in some instances, the government agency is able to compromise that debt if the 
debtor is unable to repay it within a reasonable amount of 
time
 The agency should consider the age, health, present and potential income, as well as assets of the 
debtor, in order to determine the --JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, the lawyer and the agency and the client sit down, and the lawyer 
says: Here, I can get some money for this client and that will help everybody, but I want to be paid
 So I want you, Agency, to agree that on the repayment 
schedule if I get an EAGA fee, then I get to keep it and 
I don't have to give it to my client, who will have to 
give it to the government
 And then they can sign a piece of paper and then that's done and the lawyer gets 
to keep the money
 MR
 YANG: That -- that's correct
 JUSTICE BREYER: And has that ever happened?  
 MR
 YANG: I don't know that that's happened in this offset context
 JUSTICE BREYER: But it could now
 Now people would know about, and they could do it
 MR
 YANG: It could well happen, and in fact --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what™s -- what™s the authority for the government to enter into the agreement? MR
 YANG: The authority --JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, if the statute says there has to be an offset, that's it
 MR
 YANG: Well, the statute also provides, under section , for the Department of Justice and the 
Department of Treasury to establish guidelines for 
agencies
 They have done so in Parts  to -- or  to  of Title  of the Code of Federal Regulations
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But do the guidelines reflect Justice Breyer's hypothetical? MR
 YANG: Well, the statute actually reflects Justice Breyer's hypothetical, because at 
section  -- this is at page a of the government's 
brief™s appendix -- the head of the agency, prior to 
implementing an administrative offset must advise --
this is on a -- the debtor of the opportunity to make a 
written agreement with the head of the agency to repay 
 the amount of the claim
 That reflects the practice in the Federal claims collections standards of agreeing to 
repayment of such claims
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what would motivate the government to agree to give to a 
lawyer a piece of a recovery that it, the government, 
thinks it's entitled to? I mean, it's one thing to work a repayment plan
 That starts on the proposition that the individual can only each week or month or whatever 
give a certain amount of money over
 But what --MR
 YANG: Well, I think the hypothetical was premised at the beginning of the lawsuit rather than at 
the end
 If -- if the case were at the end and the government were ordered to pay EAJA fees, the offset 
would be automatic
 We would not agree at that point to split the -- the offset with -- with the attorney
 But in the beginning of the lawsuit, when the attorney is 
undertaking representation of the client, the attorney 
is able to do precisely what Congress intended, which 
was to have debtors come to the United States and 
take -- to avail themselves of the opportunity to repay 
their debts to avoid an offset
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's a fanciful answer, because EAJA requires that the 
government's position, to get fees, is substantially  
 unjustified
 And so the government lawyer is going to sit down and say, well, you know, if I take a position 
that is substantially unjustified, I will at that point 
pay the fees to you, not to the client
 MR
 YANG: Well, not at all
 The government's interest in an installment plan is not 
motivated by EAJA
 The government™s interest is --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but the attorney's interest -- I thought in the hypothetical we 
were talking about, the attorney's interest is
 He thinks the government is going to take a substantially 
unjustified position, and he wants to make sure in that 
case that he gets paid
 MR
 YANG: This is a separate question, which is whether there is really any deterrent or how 
large the deterrent effect would be having the specter 
of a fee offset
 And as we explained in our brief, this Court in Underwood explained that, because EAJA awards 
are not given to every prevailing party and are only 
given to parties where the government's position is not 
substantially justified, it is -- one cannot reliably 
determine in advance whether the government's position 
is going to be so unreasonable that you™re going to get 
an award of fees
 And that -- that suggests that any deterrent  
 effect of having the possibility of an offsetting -- an 
offset for the client's debt is small
 And that --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's going to look awful bad to a court that comes in and he's --
and the court is asked to award EAJA fees, and there is 
an agreement already in effect
 The government says, well, if we™re -- you know, if we™re liable for EAJA 
fees, this is how we are going to handle it
 MR
 YANG: I may have misspoken --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would be the first piece of -- that would be the first piece of 
evidence that I would want to put in saying I should get 
EAJA fees
 The government thought they might even take a position that qualified
 MR
 YANG: Let me back up
 I may have misspoken
 What I intended to convey is that at the beginning of the case when an attorney is deciding 
whether to represent a client, the case has not been 
litigated, we don't know whether the government's 
position is going to be found to be substantially 
unjustified or not, the attorney -- if the attorney 
checks and wants to determine whether the client has 
a -- a debt owed to the government that would be subject 
to offset, the attorney can go to the government and say: 
Let's enter into a repayment plan so that my debtor gets  
 on the government's good graces and no longer is subject to 
have a tax -- a tax return, for instance, offset or any 
other payment that the government may owe to that 
debtor in the future, including EAJA
 But it's not because of the EAJA payment that you would enter into 
the agreement
 The government --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but say he goes in to the government and says, look, I™m about to sue 
you, and I™d like to sit down and negotiate a nice 
agreement about the repayment
 MR
 YANG: Well, I guess the attorney may say, I'm about to sue you, but the government certainly 
is not motivated because of the lawsuit
 The government -- whether an attorney is going to sue the 
government or not, the question is --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Government lawyers are always sympathetic to people who come in and say: 
I'm going to sue you
 (Laughter
) MR
 YANG: Well, I guess that certainly gets our attention
 But the reason that the government would enter into a repayment agreement is because that is an 
opportunity for the government to collect a debt that is 
delinquent, valid, and outstanding
 And what Congress intended to do in the Debt  
 Collection Improvement Act was not to have additional 
Federal funds be paid to debtors who have been given 
multiple warnings of the debt and are essentially, you 
know --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem with your argument is this pot of money is actually not going 
to -- it's going to the debtor, according to your 
argument, because in theory the debtor is the prevailing 
party and is entitled to get the award
 But the money is not being paid to the debtor
 It's for the benefit of the lawyer who has done the work that Congress wanted 
done
 MR
 YANG: Well, actually, either --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know what the --I don't know what the motivation would be for a lawyer 
to undertake to represent the meritorious claim when 
they have to not only do the work in the case, but now 
have to do the work for the government in getting their 
client to negotiate an agreement with the government on 
something that's completely unrelated to the claim
 MR
 YANG: I guess a --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's -- it's sort of --MR
 YANG: There™s a few answers --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- illogical
 MR
 YANG: There™s a few answers to that
  
 EAJA applies not only in the Social Security context; it 
applies in all civil actions in which -- not sounding in 
tort, in which there™s not another specific fee 
provision, brought -- brought by or against the United 
States
 Congress intended -- and this is in the statutory findings which precede EAJA in section -- I 
believe it's  of the Act; it is -- to diminish the 
financial deterrent on individuals, businesses, and 
organizations caused by the expense of providing -- of 
litigating a case
 This is --JUSTICE GINSBURG: That sounds like you're -- you have -- the client has an agreement to pay 
the lawyer or the client has paid the lawyer
 It would make sense if the client has paid the lawyer and then 
there is reimbursement under EAJA that what -- what 
you're describing would make sense in that situation
 
But in most of these situations, the client doesn't have 
the wherewithal to pay the attorney upfront, of course
 MR
 YANG: That may be true in the Social Security context, but there are many instances in 
which -- this is the -- this is the normal way that, 
you know, clients and -- and -- and their -- their 
attorneys work out fee arrangements
 Sometimes clients will pay their attorney in advance; sometimes they will  
 pay as the litigation goes forward
 And by the time you have the EAJA award the client will have paid all or 
part -- sometimes none -- but all or part of the -- of 
the fee award
 JUSTICE GINSBURGH: Is it --MR
 YANG: Congress directed -- the language is very clear: Courts shall award to the prevailing party fees and expenses --JUSTICE GINSBURG: And does that mean --MR
 YANG: -- incurred by the party
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The award goes to the prevailing party
 So, therefore, the attorney's fee is income to the client --MR
 YANG: I --JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- is taxable income to the client? MR
 YANG: This is -- the answer to that is complicated and, generally, yes
 The IRS is of the view that attorney fee awards to prevailing parties, whether 
it's EAJA or otherwise, are deemed to be taxable income 
to the client
 Now, the clients, of course, will have an offsetting deduction for expenses incurred by -- in --
in the course of producing or collecting income, and 
that was recognized by this Court's opinion in Banks
  
 That deduction is, of course, subject to certain limits
 
It has to be in excess of  percent of the adjusted 
gross income and subject to the alternative minimum tax, 
which wouldn't apply to Social Security claims
 But the general answer is yes, it is income when the prevailing party receives a fee
 There is an offsetting deduction
 However, there's a -- some uncertainty with whether some fee awards when the 
underlying benefit obtained is not taxable, whether 
that -- the IRS will treat such payments to -- the fee 
awards, as --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Like pain and suffering, but that's not --MR
 YANG: Yes, so, but also certain Federal benefits, including Social Security benefits, 
have a very complicated tax relationship
 Social Security benefits are taxable in part
 It depends on the size and the amount of other income
 So, the answer is actually quite complicated whether fees are taxable under EAJA in the Social 
Security context
 But the general rule is, yes, fee awards to a prevailing party are income and subject 
to --JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then, in turn, income to the attorney when -- if the client -- 
 MR
 YANG: Correct
 Just as, you know, when I'm -- you know, I am paid my salary and taxed on it, 
and then when I pay for services, the person to whom I 
pay also has income, and they are taxed as well
 This is not an unusual situation
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me the underlying assumption -- and some of the question would 
have been put to you by the court -- is that the 
government has somehow benefited because the money is 
created to offset the debt
 It really isn't
 It would -- this would be true if an attorney were suing 
a third party and creating a fund, and the government 
said, ah, there's the money
 In this case, it's just being paid from one account to the other
 The government would be better off if there were no suit 
at all
 MR
 YANG: That's correct
 If the government never had an EAJA award, it at least would 
be less of a debt that it could collect
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's just paying itself from one account to the other
 MR
 YANG: That's correct
 The government is -- ultimately zeroes out here
 The person that gets the benefit is the prevailing party, because the 
prevailing party has eliminated a debt to the United 
 States by having that offset by the EAJA award
 So the prevailing party obtains the benefit, which is precisely 
what Congress intended here
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The government zeroes out, but in the course of it, it has taken a 
legal position in court against a small business that 
was substantially unjustified
 MR
 YANG: And it has paid its EAJA award by offsetting that award against the debt that the business 
owed to the United States
 The government is -- at the end of the day, the balance sheets of the government 
have not changed
 And with -- from the perspective of --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I think the idea -- well --MR
 YANG: From the perspective of the prevailing party as well
 The prevailing party has an obligation to the attorney
 Those are the attorney's fees incurred which have not yet been paid
 The prevailing party also has an obligation to the 
government in the -- in the amount of a debt
 It has income that comes in through the -- through the fee 
award, and whether that goes to offset the debt to the 
government or offset the -- for use to pay the attorney, 
the prevailing party ultimately gets the benefit of that 
fee award
 And the government has paid the EAJA award  
 as required by statute
 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you happen to know how much the -- the Treasury typically collects in a year 
under these EAJA offsets? Does it put a dent in the Federal deficit? MR
 YANG: We don't, and the reason we don't is because each agency that -- which is the subject of 
an EAJA order submits to Treasury a payment request 
based on that order, and they check ﬁmiscellaneous 
payment
ﬂ That agency doesn't know whether that payment is offset
 Treasury receives that -- that request of payment and sees that it's a miscellaneous payment, 
checks it against a debt, and may offset
 But Treasury doesn't know that the miscellaneous payment was an EAJA 
award
 So we don't have any statistics that we can point to, to say how often this -- this occurs
 I can say that the financial management service executes one 
-- over one billion payments per year, and that offsets 
of those payments account for $
 billion
 So about two-tenths of  percent of payments from the Federal 
Government result in offsets
 I™d like to reserve the balance of my time
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
  
 Mr
 Leach
 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D
 LEACH ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MR
 LEACH: Mr
 Chief Justice, may it please the Court: I™d like to discuss with you this morning four reasons why Catherine Ratliff, and not the 
government, is entitled to receive the fee for the legal 
services she performed, that Congress invited her to 
perform, to show that the government's position was 
legally erroneous and was not even substantially 
justified
 And my first point arises from your question, Justice Scalia
 You asked whether State law determines who has the priorities here in terms of 
offset, if I understood
 And the answer is that actually Federal law determines that, specifically the 
Debt Collection Improvement Act and regulations
 The Act requires mutuality of a debt between the debtor and 
the government before the government can offset
 And the regulations, which I™ll quote in just an instant, 
require that before offset can occur, the government must 
look to who has the beneficial interest in the payment
 
In other words, who is entitled to benefit from it
 Specifically,  C
F
R
 
(b), which is 
 quoted at page  of the red brief, defines, quote, 
"offset," close quote, as withholding funds to satisfy 
a debt owed by a payee
 And "payee" -- and this is critical -- is defined as the same -- in the same 
regulation, also quoted at page  of our reply brief, 
as "the person entitled" -- as the person entitled to 
the benefit of all or part of a payment
 In other words, not the legal title holder if there is a 
difference, but the person with the beneficial interest
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The prevailing party gets the benefit in the sense that she is relieved of 
the debt she owed to the government
 That's a real benefit
 MR
 LEACH: Well, Your Honor, I think that's a benefit -- true, that's a benefit, I agree; but that's 
not a benefit, I don't think, in the sense of who --
because the question is who has the beneficial interest 
in the fee payment? And when we look to that question, because that's what's at issue here, is the fee payment
 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't this argument circular? The -- the issue is who is -- to whom is this payment to be made
 And if it's to be made to the --the claimant, then it's not for the beneficial interest 
of the -- of the attorney
 MR
 LEACH: Two responses, if I could,  
 Justice Alito: First, the word "payment" gets thrown around a lot in the briefs
 It can mean two separate things
 It can mean who receives the payment first; in other words, who is the check mailed to; or it can mean 
who the check is ultimately entitled to -- who is 
entitled to benefit from it
 And the government's -- my second point is the government's reply brief at page  to  concedes 
that, but for the government's alleged right to offset, 
the attorney does indeed have the beneficial interest in 
the attorney's fee
 And the government gives three reasons, and only three reasons, why its alleged right 
to offset trumps the attorney's beneficial interest
 The first reason the government gives is the government says that the -- the constructive trust, which 
the government acknowledges exists in the -- in -- in 
favor of the attorney with respect to the fee payment, 
does not arise until the instant the fee reaches the 
client
 And that's true, but that's not the point
 The point is the attorney had the beneficial interest in the fee, which had to precede the 
moment the fee reached the client, if it's payable to 
the client in the sense of "sent to
" The beneficial interest had to precede that in order for a constructive 
trust to arise
  
 The government's second argument --JUSTICE BREYER: On the first one, imagine that the -- a trust owes some money to the government
 
Now, suppose a lawyer representing the trust recovers
 
Now, they recover on a separate debt, okay? Separate debt? One
 That money goes to the trust
 Right? MR
 LEACH: If -- I'm not --JUSTICE BREYER: The trust first owes -- the trust owes $, to the government
 The trust then independently recovers $ from the government on a 
different matter
 MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: The government couldn't offset that? MR
 LEACH: Of course it could
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes
 Of course it could
 MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: But the trust is not a person entitled to the benefit of the payment
 MR
 LEACH: Well --JUSTICE BREYER: The beneficiaries of the trust are entitled to the benefit of the payment
 MR
 LEACH: If I understood your hypothetical, if the trust is entitled to $, then the 
trust I think would be entitled to the benefit of the 
 payment
 JUSTICE BREYER: It's not entitled to the benefit of the $
 The trust holds money for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust
 So --MR
 LEACH: I --JUSTICE BREYER: -- it can™t -- you agree that that couldn't be? MR
 LEACH: Well --JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and once you agree that that couldn't be, I think you are in trouble on 
your first argument
 I'm not sure
 MR
 LEACH: Okay
 I don't think so, because if we are talking about payments to persons, you know, 
if a person -- if a person owes a debt of $,, 
receives $ on the debt, the person receives the 
benefit of that $
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, similarly, the -- the guy -- the client here receives the benefit of the money 
that he has just gotten from the government, including 
the attorney's fees
 It happens that he can't keep those attorney's fees, just as the trust can't keep the 
$
 He has to give the attorney's fees to the lawyer, just as the trust eventually has to give the $ to the 
beneficiary
 So I'm simply saying -- drawing a  
 parallel, which -- go on to the next issue
 MR
 LEACH: All right, Your Honor
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let me -- can trusts -- can trusts recover EAJA fees? MR
 LEACH: I don't know, Your Honor
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I don't either
 I™m looking at the definition
 It doesn't say "trust
" It says a lot of other things, like corporation, 
association, unit of government
 I just don't --JUSTICE KENNEDY: I™m having trouble with this aspect, and it may -- may be that it varies from 
State to State
 But as a general matter, under State law, let's say that the employee makes a contingency fee 
arrangement with a lawyer to sue the employer and wins 
$,
 It's a one-third contingent fee
 The -- the employee already owes the employer $,
 It would seem to me under the general principle of offset that 
the employer has to only pay $,, and the attorney 
is not going to get his full fee
 MR
 LEACH: That™s --JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's just --that's just the law of offsets
 MR
 LEACH: That's true
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because again, it's the same party
 If they created money by suing some third  
 person, then that's different
 MR
 LEACH: I think that's true
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and so I -- it seems to me that what you're -- what you're asking for 
is just contrary to the standard law of offsets
 MR
 LEACH: Well, Your Honor, with what I --JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's even worse because the Federal statute says that there shall be 
this offset first as a matter of priority
 MR
 LEACH: Actually, Your Honor, the Federal statute provides for offset in accordance with 
regulations to be issued by the Treasury Department
 
And those Treasury Department regulations were what I 
quoted right at the beginning of my argument
 We have to look at who is entitled to the benefit of the 
payment, not the benefit in a generalized sense of the 
lawsuit
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in the generalized sense of -- of common law of offsets, as I've described 
to it, sure, the attorney has a beneficial interest, but 
he's not going to be able to collect it vis-à-vis the 
employer who is entitled to an offset
 MR
 LEACH: Yes
 And the difference, Your Honor, is that in your hypothetical we™re talking about 
one sum of money that™s recovered in the name of the  
 claimant
 In this situation, we™re talking about a statutory fee award, which is created only based on the 
work of the attorney and which is labeled an attorney's 
fee and separate from the benefit --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how is it different? Look
 This, what I was talking about, has nothing to do 
With EAJA
 MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: It has to do with when the government's allowed to offset some money
 MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: And it's allowed to offset some money when the money is money that it would otherwise 
give to a payee
 All right? MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: And then you've defined "payee" as a person who has some beneficial interest in 
that money
 MR
 LEACH: Yes
 Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: And I think that the client here has no more and no less beneficial interest whether 
he's a person or whether he's a trust
 That was my point
 MR
 LEACH: I understand, Your Honor
 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay
  
 MR
 LEACH: And my point about the statute is simply that the statute is subject to the regulation 
which looks to who's entitled to benefit
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, let's take the regulation: "A person who is entitled to the benefit of all or part of the payment
" Ultimately, isn't it the plaintiff who has recovered that is entitled to the 
benefit, because this money is given to him in order 
that he can meet a financial obligation that he owes to 
the lawyer? I mean, if this didn't exist, he'd owe the lawyer and have to pony it up out of his own pocket, no? MR
 LEACH: Not so, Your Honor, in Social Security cases, which this is, and in Veterans cases, 
which together account for more than  percent of all 
EAJA awards
 In Social Security cases,  U
S
C
 (b)(), set out in our appendix, makes it a Federal 
crime for any lawyer to charge, receive, demand, or 
collect a fee payment directly from a client, other than 
under past -- the  U
S
C
  past-due benefits,  
percent, or EAJA
 And this is a critical difference
 In the non-EAJA, in the non-Social Security, non-Veterans 
contexts, you know, about  percent of cases, you've got 
-- conceivably, you've got, often, clients paying lawyers 
 on a traditional pay-as-you-go basis
 But in a Social Security case or a Veterans case --JUSTICE SCALIA: And in those cases, you agree the offset can be made? MR
 LEACH: Absolutely
 Absolutely
 The difference here in all these Social Security and Veterans cases is that the attorney is 
barred by law from receiving money on a 
pay-as-you-go basis
 So the attorney has never been paid
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In exchange for getting  percent of the recovery? MR
 LEACH: No
 Actually, Your Honor, in exchange for showing in Federal court, if I understand 
your question
 I hope I do
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: My understanding is that the ordinary payment to the lawyer for Social Security 
benefits gained for the client is  percent of the 
recovery to the client paid directly to the lawyer
 MR
 LEACH: That's true
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that, just as a background in this case, did Ms
 Ratliff get that 
 percent? MR
 LEACH: No, Your Honor
 There was no  percent fee here
  
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that was because it was too small to be bothered with? What was the reason? MR
 LEACH: She did not apply for a  percent fee
 It would have been quite small, had she received it
 It would have been much smaller than the EAJA fee
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And she could keep only one from the --MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: She could keep only the larger of the two
 MR
 LEACH: Had she received the EAJA fee, she could have kept it
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One of the difficulties with your position is that Congress did exempt a number 
of Federal payments from the offset, but it didn't 
exempt Equal Access to Justice fees
 MR
 LEACH: Yes
 And the -- there are two points there, Your Honor
 I mean, EAJA fees -- I'm not claiming all EAJA fees are exempt
 As I just said --spoke with you, Justice Scalia, if the -- in a non-Social 
Security, non-Veterans case where the client has paid 
the attorney and then an EAJA fee comes down, that™s 
clearly subject to offset
 You have to look to that regulation and who is entitled to the benefit of the fee 
 payment
 And the reason that the Debt Collection Improvement Act doesn't address this in  is that in 
, the government had never taken the position that 
attorney fees were subject to offset in Social Security 
or Veterans cases
 And in fact, in , there were three court of appeals decisions on the question of 
whether a creditor could offset a statutory fee award: 
Plant -- these are all of our briefs -- Plant, Fourth 
Circuit, ; Duncan -- I'm sorry, Plant is Fifth 
Circuit, ; Duncan, Fourth Circuit, ; Curtis, 
Eighth Circuit, 
 All those cases said that the creditor may not offset a statutory fee award against the creditor's 
debt because the fee is for the attorney
 That™s why Congress couldn't have conceivably thought to address it 
in 
 And some of the questions take me toward the point that you asked about before, Justice Roberts --
Chief Justice Roberts
 And you suggested, or you said, that EAJA says: Pay to the prevailing party
 If I heard you correctly
 In fact, Your Honor, the language of the statute is, quote, "award to the prevailing party


 
fees and other expenses


incurred by that party
" And the two parts that we haven't really  
 addressed yet are that what is awarded is attorney's 
fees
 And this "incurred by" language -- with respect to that attorney's fee language, "attorney's fees" has a 
traditional meaning
 It's a meaning this Court has recognized in all those cases bullet-pointed at pages  
to  of our briefs
 It's a fee earned by and paid to an attorney
 And in Gisbrecht v
 Barnhart in , this Court specifically described the real parties in 
interest in attorney's fees litigation as the attorneys, 
recognizing the reality that attorney fees go to 
attorneys
 In addition, the language "incurred by that party" -- what does it mean here? Well, outside of EAJA, it could mean -- it does mean, I think -- money the 
client takes out and pays to the attorney
 We know in Social Security cases and Veterans cases it can't mean 
that, because that's illegal
 That's a Federal crime if the attorney does it
 So what does it mean? Well, the government concedes at page  of its reply brief that that language 
"incurred by" a prevailing party is supported by the 
client's implied or express obligation to pay the 
attorney the fee received
 So this is where the government's argument is circular, I think, 
Justice Alito, in the sense that that "incurred by"  
 language only is satisfied and an EAJA award only may be 
made where the client has the express or implied 
obligation to pay the attorney
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you say that in Social Security the attorney is forbidden to accept 
pay-as-you-go? Is --MR
 LEACH: Yes, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that doesn't mean that there is not either an express or an implied contract 
between the attorney and the Social Security recipient
 MR
 LEACH: I agree
 That's what I was trying to say
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but if there is that implied contract, then it is an obligation of the 
recipient
 MR
 LEACH: Yes, that's what I was trying to say, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't see how that leads you where you want to go
 Then the payment given to the recipient does indeed benefit the recipient by --
by paying off an obligation that the Social Security 
recipient has
 MR
 LEACH: Yes, but that obligation exists only to the extent of the EAJA fee
 It's not a separate obligation
 The attorney can't turn around and go  
 against the client
 I mean, (b)() prohibits the attorney going against the client for any fee other than 
the (b) fee, which is separate, if there is a (b) 
fee, or the EAJA fee
 And when --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is it --MR
 LEACH: We have been talking -- I'm sorry
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just so I'm clarifying, is it your position -- and this is something I want to 
ask the government as well -- that once the EAJA fee is 
awarded, the attorney couldn't sue the client later even 
in an offset situation for repayment, because by statute 
you view them as blocked from --MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- from seeking anything other than the EAJA fee or the  fee? MR
 LEACH: Yes, that's what (b)() says, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that once the offset happens, the attorney, under -- even if the client had 
other money, the attorney would be blocked from going 
after it? MR
 LEACH: Yes, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because by the terms of the statute they can only seek the EAJA fee?  
 MR
 LEACH: They can only seek what? JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Either the EAJA fee or the  fee
 MR
 LEACH: Yes, and we have been talking as if EAJA fees and (b) fees are sort of contemporaneous 
in every case
 In fact, the data cited at page  of the red brief is that  percent of Federal court Social 
Security cases result in a remand
 Only  percent result in an award of benefits
 So there are going to be far more EAJA fees in Federal court than there ever are (b) fees
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you calculate the fee under either the Social Security Act or EAJA, depending 
on the case? Do you ever calculate it under both so that you get some under each? MR
 LEACH: Yes, Your Honor
 And that's --JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the -- you calculate it under both so you get some under each? MR
 LEACH: No, section  says how this works, of the -- of EAJA 
 It says if there are two fees, the attorney keeps the larger fee --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right
 MR
 LEACH: -- and sends the smaller to the client and vice versa
 And that™s the situation, for example, where you could have an offset of an EAJA fee in a 
 Social Security case
 Let's say there is a (b) fee that's $,
 Let's say there is an EAJA fee that is $,
 Under section , that -- the attorney doesn't keep that $,
 That $, winds up in the client's pocket
 The government can offset that
 That's --that's what integrates all this discussion we™ve been 
having about EAJA fees not being exempt
 We have to look to the beneficial interest
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In what percent of the Social Security cases where the claimant prevails is 
there an EAJA fee? MR
 LEACH: Forty-six percent
 No, that's not right
 It's about  percent
 And I get that from combining two numbers
 There are , EAJA awards per year
 That's red brief page 
 And there are about , Social Security civil cases per year
 That's green brief page 
 Fifty-four -- , divided by , is  percent
 And this bring me to the point the government was making in suggesting that an attorney at 
the beginning of a case could never know whether or 
not there -- there is going to be an EAJA fee, because, 
you know, you can't know at the beginning, they argue, 
what position the government will take, whether or not 
the government's position is substantially justified or  
 not
 Well -- and the government cites Pierce/Underwood from  from this Court, in which 
this Court said exactly that -- Pierce v
 Underwood
 Pierce v
 Underwood is outside the Social Security context, outside the Veterans context, so 
Pierce v
 Underwood is in this less than  percent 
category of cases under EAJA which are not Social 
Security or Veterans
 In a Social Security case or a Veterans case, the attorney has the record before proceeding into 
court, before deciding whether to proceed into court
 
And the attorney can look at that record, read it, and 
have a pretty good idea of whether or not the government 
position might be substantially justified or not
 I don't ask you to take my word for any of this
 Let me tell you what the data shows
 The data, Justice Ginsburg -- this is where the  percent of Federal Social Security cases result 
in an EAJA award
 If it's  percent, that's quite a high number of cases in which the government's position 
is found substantially -- not substantially justified as 
well as legally erroneous
 In Veterans cases, it's even worse
 The Court of Veterans Appeal Web site -- this the number of  
 cases -- all together -- number of dispositions per year 
and the number of EAJA awards
 And for  and , if you add up the numbers, out of all the Veterans 
disability cases filed,  percent, -, result in an 
EAJA award
 So there™s quite a large number of cases in which -- in -- in a Veterans context or Social 
Security context where the government's position is 
found not to be --JUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand your earlier point
 MR
 LEACH: I'm sorry
 JUSTICE BREYER: Imagine that if Joe Smith is in a lot of financial trouble
 MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: His house is being foreclosed on --MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- all his bank accounts are attached
 Then he gets some money from the government and -- including an EAJA fee
 MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: And it's $, of money and , for the fee
 They put it in his bank account
 It was attached, good-bye, nobody sees the money, because 
it's whoever attached it got the money
 Is that  
 possible? MR
 LEACH: Are we talking about the government? JUSTICE BREYER: I'm making this up
 I'm not talking about the government
 I'm saying the government paid him , plus , in an EAJA fee, and 
the bank got all the money because it had attached his 
bank account
 Is that possible? MR
 LEACH: Is this in a Social Security --JUSTICE BREYER: I'm making it up
 No
 It has nothing to do with -- I'm just making up --MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- a hypothetical
 MR
 LEACH: Yes, it is
 Sorry
 JUSTICE BREYER: All right? MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: You follow that
 Those are the facts
 MR
 LEACH: I think so
 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay
 So a year later, Joe Smith is doing much better
 Couldn't the attorney now sue him for the $,, say I™d like it? It went to the bank because they had attached the bank account
 MR
 LEACH: Outside the Social Security context, yes, I think so
  
 JUSTICE BREYER: All right
 Now, suppose it happened to be that that ,,  for the one and  for 
the other, came from Social Security
 Then how does that make a difference? MR
 LEACH: The bank could not take it because of the anti-assignment provision --JUSTICE BREYER: It couldn't take ,? MR
 LEACH: Couldn't take any of it under --JUSTICE BREYER: Couldn't take any of it
 Because of? MR
 LEACH: --  U
S
C
 
 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that in here? MR
 LEACH: Yes,  U
S
C
  -- it's cited, if it™s not quoted -- prohibits assignment of Social 
Security benefits
 But, Justice Breyer, if I --JUSTICE BREYER: And the EAJA fee counts as a Social Security benefit? MR
 LEACH: Oh, I'm sorry
 I thought we were outside the Social Security context
 JUSTICE BREYER: I changed it and said, now, how does it matter if it™s Social Security? (Laughter
) MR
 LEACH: If it's an EAJA fee in a Social Security context, the bank cannot take that because of 
the Federal -- well, because the attorney -- the 
 government admits the constructive trust exists in favor of the attorney with respect to those funds
 JUSTICE BREYER: If you win this case? MR
 LEACH: No
 The government says -- has said that in its reply brief
 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words -- in other words, no one can attach? No one can -- no one get the EAJA fee by attaching the bank account of the client? MR
 LEACH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay
 MR
 LEACH: And I wanted to get back to the point you asked, Justice Breyer --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, skip my points
 They™re too complicated
 (Laughter
) MR
 LEACH: Well -- but during -- during Mr
 Yang's argument, you asked about this -- this 
repayment agreement
 The concept of a repayment agreement being any use to a lawyer who is thinking 
about taking one of these cases is fanciful for two 
reasons: Number one, SSI benefits by statute are limited to, quote, "aged, blind, and disabled people who 
have little or no money
" So, I don't know where the disabled or blind or aged person is going to get the money to enter into  
 any repayment agreement
 But the second reason it's fanciful is that the attorney only has  days from final agency action 
to file the case in Federal court
 And, so, there is  days to, you know, meet with the client and try to 
get an answer out of the government
 I've never tried to do this -- I don't know anyone who has -- but I don't 
think you™re going to get much of an answer at  days 
asking the government to do this so the attorney can 
then recover a fee
 Finally, there™s -- there™s a critical point here that I need to get to, which is that I think 
Congress has told us exactly what this language means
 
Here's why
 In , Congress enacts EAJA and uses this section  language which talks about who gets the fee, 
large or smaller fee
 Okay
 In , Congress extends EAJA to Veterans claims
 And when it does that, in  U
S
C
 , Congress uses the same language, down to the exact commas in the same place, that it has done in 

 During this entire period -- and here's why that's important -- during that entire period from  
to , and indeed continuing many years after that, 
but for purposes here, , the administration is every  
 time paying the attorney™s fee to the attorney under 
EAJA
 And so when Congress in  uses the same language for Veterans EAJA claims that it used for 
Social Security EAJA claims  years earlier, 
Congress, as a matter of law, is incorporating the 
settled administrative construction --JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the -- I thought the government said they only did that when --
when the court directed that it be paid to the attorney
 MR
 LEACH: Mr
 Yang was talking about from  on
 From  -- from  to , every EAJA fee went to the attorney
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because there was no offset in the picture because the government wasn't 
offsetting
 MR
 LEACH: Two responses, Your Honor: The offset came into the picture in , but the government 
says it wasn't practical to 
 Even if you grant them that point, the agency had to make -- totally apart from 
offset, the agency had to decide who these fees should 
be paid to under section  -- I mean under EAJA
 The government had to say, who does this statute say fees should be paid to? Now, had the government said, well, fees go to the client, says, you 
know, award to the prevailing party, fees and other  
 expenses, we are going to pay attorney's fees to 
clients, which had never happened
 But had the government said that -- that's not what they said
 They look at the statute
 They look at the fact that the attorney earned the fees, and they say we 
are going to pay these fees to the attorney
 So that's what™s going on at the time Congress in  copies its 
 language --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Congress has provided in some statutes, the Social Security Act itself, , 
that you quoted, for the fee to be paid directly to the 
attorney
 Here it used different language; it said pay the prevailing party
 MR
 LEACH: Just two points, Justice Ginsburg: Number one, we get back to this question about does payment mean who receives the check 
or who is entitled to benefit from it? Number two, EAJA doesn't say pay to the party
 EAJA doesn't use the phrase ﬁpaymentﬂ;  says payment to the attorney
 EAJA doesn't say that, "payment," at all
 The only place you find "pay" in EAJA is where it says the government 
cannot be required to pay a filing fee
 There is this, shall award to a prevailing party fees and other expenses, and (d)()(A) defines 
ﬁfeesﬂ to include quote, "attorney fees," close quote
  
 I'm finishing my sentence, Your Honor
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead
 MR
 LEACH: Thank you
 And -- and so ﬁpaymentﬂ isn't even in EAJA
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 MR
 LEACH: Thank you very much, Your Honor
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr
 Yang, you have  minutes remaining
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR
 YANG: I believe I heard counsel concede that EAJA fees outside of the Social Security context 
are payable to the prevailing party and therefore 
subject to offset
 That's true
 EAJA does not draw a distinction between Social Security fees and other types 
of fees
 Section  uses the same language, court shall award to the prevailing party fees and other 
expenses
 I believe that disposes of this case
 Second, counsel relies on a definition of ﬁrepresentative payeeﬂ in the offset regulations
 That's addressed at reply -- our reply, page , footnote 
 A representative payee -- as the Federal Register provisions 
that relate to this make clear, it refers to things like 
attorneys, it refers to things like parents, where the 
beneficial interest is not that of the attorney or the 
 parent but the client and the child
 It would be entirely unworkable if any time that a payee owes some debt that a third party might 
claim an interest to, that the government would have to 
find out the payee's finances and obligations in order 
to execute an offset
 It's simply not the way the offset program was designed, and it's not reflected in 
the regulation
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, is your adversary correct that under (b) --MR
 YANG: ()
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- (b)(), that if these attorneys -- if any attorney attempts to collect from 
a Social Security or Veterans client any fees outside 
of those granted --MR
 YANG: No
 Section (b) of the EAJA, which is reproduced on a of our appendix, states that 
section (b)(), the provision you were talking about, 
shall not apply with respect to any such award, meaning 
any award under EAJA, so long as where the attorney 
receives fees, the smaller fee is returned
 So --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do you -- do you dispute your friend's statement that  percent of 
the time in Social Security cases the government's 
position is unjustified, and  percent of the time in  
 Veterans cases? MR
 YANG: Well, I think that reflects the stakes often, Your Honor
 Oftentimes the government does not contest, for instance, a $, EAJA award 
and because it's the government, it has to --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So whenever it really makes a difference --MR
 YANG: No --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: --  percent of the time the government's position is substantially unjustified? MR
 YANG: In cases -- in the VA context, the number is not quite that large, but there™s a substantial 
number of cases at the court of appeals --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What number would you accept? MR
 YANG: It was, I believe, in the order of either  or maybe slightly more than  percent
 It might be 
 But the number is substantial that you get a reversal, and in almost all of those cases, EAJA --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's really startling, isn't it? In litigating with veterans, the government more often than not takes a position that is 
substantially unjustified? MR
 YANG: It is an unfortunate number, Your Honor
 And it is -- it's accurate
  
 this case begin and end on whether or not what the jury 
found is reasonable grounds for what the city did? MR
 RICHLAND: I think that what this case begins and ends with, if we assume that there was a 
reasonable expectation of privacy, is under the 
plurality opinion in O'Connor: Whether the search itself was reasonable
 And the jury did, of course, make a determination as to the purpose of the search
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess we don't decide our -- our Fourth Amendment privacy cases on the basis 
of whether there -- there was an absolute guarantee of 
privacy from everybody
 I think -- I think those cases say that if you think it can be made public by anybody, 
you don't -- you don't really have a right of privacy
 So when the -- when the filthy-minded police chief listens in, it's a very bad thing, but it's not --
it™s not offending your right of privacy
 You expected somebody else could listen in, if not him
 MR
 RICHLAND: I think that's correct, Justice Scalia
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it is
 MR
 RICHLAND: And I think the reason why you must have the two-step analysis in a case of this 
sort -- that is, first look at the question as to 
whether there™s a reasonable expectation of privacy,  
 and then determine, if there was, whether the search was 
reasonable -- is precisely for the reason that, without 
that, what we will have in every case is the claim that 
there was a salacious reason, that that was the reason
 
And we™ll be litigating every one of those cases --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then, according to what you just said, the jury determination was superfluous
 
If there was no reasonable expectation of privacy 
because the officers were told this is just -- we 
treat this just like e-mails, it can be monitored, it 
can be made public, then there would be no reasonable 
expectation of privacy and there would be no question to 
go to the jury
 MR
 RICHLAND: That™s correct, Justice Ginsburg
 And it is our position that this should never have gone to the jury, that summary 
judgment should have been granted in favor of the 
Ontario Police Department
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you have two arguments: One, that it's -- there™s no reasonable expectation of 
privacy; even if there were, that this was a reasonable 
search
 MR
 RICHLAND: That™s correct
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is reasonable expectation of privacy a judge question or a jury question?  
 MR
 RICHLAND: Well, if there is a conflict in the facts, I presume the jury must resolve those --
that factual conflict
 But in this case, I don't believe there is a conflict in the facts, and, therefore, 
it is a judge question
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did your client treat on-duty text messages different from off-duty text 
messages? MR
 RICHLAND: It did, once there was an initial determination made as to the --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did it do that? MR
 RICHLAND: Excuse me
 I'm sorry
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did it treat them differently? Under your theory, they™re all the same -- no expectation of privacy
 MR
 RICHLAND: It treated them differently out of -- because there were two aspects to the case
 
One aspect was the initial determination that Chief 
Sharp ordered to say: I just want to know, is our character limit efficacious here, or do we need to have 
a higher character limit? And for that purpose, they needed to just look at all of them
 And they did; they looked at all of the text messages
 But then when they saw that some of them may have involved violations of department regulations, then 
 it was sent to Internal Affairs, and they redacted the 
off-duty messages because they were --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that something like the plain view argument? In search and -- search and --MR
 RICHLAND: I suppose
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm serious
 In other words, there is, under your view --MR
 RICHLAND: Yes
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- legitimate grounds to look at the messages, and then once they see it, they 
don't have to ignore it
 MR
 RICHLAND: I think that™s correct, Justice Kennedy
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why did -- I'm sorry
 I still don't understand
 It redacted them, right? MR
 RICHLAND: Redacted because the inquiry -- the second stage of the inquiry in Internal Affairs --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes
 MR
 RICHLAND: -- was simply to determine how much time was being spent on duty sending personal messages
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right
 MR
 RICHLAND: So the Internal Affairs Department said: We don't need to look at the off-duty messages
 We™re going to redact them
 Why get into all  
 of that? We don't have to look
 The department was pretty scrupulous
 And I think that's part of what makes the entire approach that 
they took to this reasonable
 It makes the search aspect of the case reasonable
 And I think it's important, in that regard, to look at the nature --JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me
 You said they did get to the off-duty text messaging later? MR
 RICHLAND: No, it was the other way around
 They looked at the on-duty text messaging at the later stage, at the Internal Affairs stage
 But they looked at all of the text messages when the only 
purpose for the inquiry was to determine how many of the 
text messages in general are job-related and how many 
were personal? Because the question was: Do we need to raise the character limit --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you don't have to look at the messages to determine that with respect 
to the off-duty messages, right? MR
 RICHLAND: Well -- well, you did, because of the fact, Mr
 Chief Justice, that there were 
job-related communications even while there was 
off-duty
 These officers were SWAT team officers
 They were on duty, as Sergeant Quon said, /
 That was one of the reasons why they had the text messaging pagers
  
 JUSTICE ALITO: If someone wanted to send a message to one of these pagers, what sort of a device 
would you need? Do you need to have another pager, or can you -- could you send a message to one of these 
devices from some other type of device? MR
 RICHLAND: No, there were messages that were sent from various other devices
 Is the question whether that could be physically done, electronically 
done? Because, yes, clearly that was --JUSTICE ALITO: Yes
 What other type of device could you use to send a message to one of these 
pagers? MR
 RICHLAND: It -- oh
 I'm not certain if it was something other than another text messaging 
pager
 It did appear that there were some e-mail entries in the transcripts themselves, which suggested 
that there might have been a way to communicate to them 
with e-mail, but that's just -- that's all in the record 
that suggests that
 JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, if they were on duty /, there weren't any off-duty messages, were 
there? (Laughter
) MR
 RICHLAND: Well, I may have misspoke
 They were on call /
 They were the SWAT team, and 
 they had to respond to emergencies
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If we take it that the Stored Communications Act does say that the provider may 
not give out the transcripts, if we take that as given, 
then how can the department lawfully use the 
transcripts? MR
 RICHLAND: Well, Justice Ginsburg, first of all, there was no -- there is no current claim that 
anything that the department did with respect to the 
Stored Communications Act was unlawful
 So it may be that the other entity, Arch Wireless, violated the 
Stored Communications Act, but that would not preclude 
the department -- which was, after all, the subscriber 
-- from requesting to see what, in fact, the transcripts 
disclosed
 But in addition to that, there is also the fact that, as I said before, a reasonable expectation of 
privacy couldn't be based simply on the fact that there 
was a statute, and particularly not a statute like the 
Stored Communications Act, because that's a statute that™s 
extremely, extremely technical
 And there is a --one has to determine whether an entity was working 
either as an electronic communications service or a 
remote computing service, and so on
 Courts are all over the board on this
 As this Court noted in United  
 States v
 Payner, a complicated law like that simply 
cannot be the basis for a reasonable expectation of 
privacy
 And if I may reserve the rest of my time, thank you
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly, counsel
 Mr
 Katyal
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K
 KATYAL, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS MR
 KATYAL: Thank you, Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Millions of employees today use technologies of their -- of their employers under policies 
established by those employers
 When a government employer has a no-privacy policy in place that governs 
the use of those technologies, ad hoc statements by a 
non-policy member cannot create a reasonable expectation 
of privacy
 Put most simply, the computer help desk cannot supplant the chief's desk
 That simple, clear rule should have decided this case
 Instead, the Ninth Circuit found that the  policy applied to pagers, but then concluded that 
that  policy was informally modified years later
 
And that decision should be reversed
 It disregards  
 this Court's repeated holdings, including  years ago in 
the Chief Justice's opinion in Engquist v
 Oregon about 
the greater amount of leeway that the government has 
when it acts as an employer
 And it also is not consistent with the plurality opinion in O'Connor, which 
observed that when the government adopts a policy that 
its employees lack privacy, no reasonable expectation of 
privacy exists
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask you this: Suppose the department asks for opinion of legal 
counsel whether or not transmittal of the transcripts by 
Arch to the department was a violation of the Act, and 
the counsel said: This was a violation of the Act; they had no right to send them to you
 Would the department then still have had a right to look at the transcripts? MR
 KATYAL: So the question is if the Stored Communications Act is violated? JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes
 Yes
 MR
 KATYAL: We don't think the Stored Communications Act was --JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but -- no, my hypothetical is that the -- that there is a legal 
counsel's opinion that this was in violation of the Act, 
and let's say the district court said it is in violation 
of the Act
 Let's say we say it™s in violation of the  
 Act
 Is that the end of case? The department cannot look at the transcripts? MR
 KATYAL: Oh, absolutely not
 I mean, I think this Court has repeatedly said that -- that 
various privacy laws don't determine the scope of the 
Fourth Amendment
 I think it said so most clearly in California v
 Greenwood
 And I think that's for a very simple reason, that things like the Stored 
Communications Act, Justice Kennedy, the Electronic 
Communications Privacy Act, came about --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, California v
 Greenwood was a question of -- of a Fourth Amendment 
standard that had to be nationwide
 So you say it's the same -- same thing here? MR
 KATYAL: I -- I do think it™s the same, and for this simple reason, that when you have a 
nationwide standard or a State standard, it™s to fill 
the gap, whatever isn™t necessarily protected by the 
Fourth Amendment
 And here --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but Greenwood was in the -- in the context of the exclusionary rule in 
criminal proceedings
 I certainly think that States --at least we could make the reasonable argument that 
States can have different policies with respect to their 
employees, that have to be respected
  
 MR
 KATYAL: Absolutely, Justice Kennedy
 I don't disagree with that
 I think the only question is, if the -- if I understand your question it™s, does a 
Federal statute about privacy somehow matter to the 
Fourth Amendment analysis about reasonable expectations 
of privacy? And there our contention is, no; it™s precisely because Congress enacted the Stored 
Communications Act to fill gaps in Fourth Amendment law
 
That -- that's why it's enacted
 And for -- for this Court to then use that very Act to be the template on which reasonable 
expectations of privacy may spring I think would be a 
very -- it would be a novel proposition
 Nor should --JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's -- that's a little bit puzzling because there are -- electronic 
communications are stored all over the place in -- and 
there isn't a history -- these are -- these are 
relatively new
 There isn't a well-established understanding about what is private and what isn't 
private
 It's a little different from putting garbage out in front of your house, which has happened for a 
long time
 If -- if statutes governing the privacy of that information don't have any bearing on reasonable 
expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment, it's 
 some -- I -- I'm at something of a loss to figure out 
how to determine whether there is a reasonable 
expectation of privacy regarding any of those things
 MR
 KATYAL: Well, Justice Alito, I do think that the underlying premise of your question is one with 
which we entirely agree
 These are technologies that are rapidly in flux, in which we don't have intuitive 
understandings the way we do about, say, trash and so 
on
 And it's precisely for that reason I think the Court should be very careful to constitutionalize and 
generate Fourth Amendment rules in this area at the 
first instance
 To do so I think really does freeze into --into -- into place something that the legislature can't 
then fix, going to Justice Kennedy's opinion in, for 
example, Murray v
 Giarratano, in which he said that 
constitutionalizing in that area -- constitutionalizing 
may pretermit legislative solutions
 Now, here the Stored Communications Act is not violated under any way, shape, or form
 The Stored Communications Act has two different provisions in it, 
one having to do with remote -- remote computing 
services, RCSs
 That's when an entity offers storage facilities
 And the other is for an electronic communications service
 That is essentially transmission  
 of messages from point to point
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your point that you made just a moment ago, that we don't want to freeze into 
place the constitutional requirements with respect to 
new technology, I wonder if it cuts the other way
 We™re dealing with an amendment that looks to whether 
something is reasonable
 And I think it might be the better course to say that the Constitution applies, but 
we™re going to be more flexible in determining what™s 
reasonable because they are dealing with evolving 
technology
 MR
 KATYAL: Well, I think that the -- the best way -- I think the most -- the easiest way for the 
Court to resolve this is to simply say that when we are 
dealing with what is reasonable, we look to the policy
 
And here there™s a policy by the employer, it says that 
computer-associated -- computer-related equipment and 
others, there™s no expectation of privacy
 You have a person who is told that repeatedly
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that puts a lot of weight -- I mean, there are some things where we 
don't bind them
 You know, you get the usual parking garage thing that has got all this small print on the 
back
 We -- we don't say that you™re bound by that, because nobody reads it
  
 But in here, I just don't know
 I just don't know how you tell what™s reasonable -- I suspect 
it might change with how old people are and how 
comfortable they are with the technology -- when you have 
all these different -- different factors
 You know, they™re told you can use it for private; you™ve got to pay for it
 I think if I pay for it, it's mine, and it™s not the employer's
 MR
 KATYAL: Well, I think the clearest way, Mr
 Chief Justice, to decide what is reasonable and what 
isn't is actually the terms of the policy
 And it seems to me very little is more unreasonable than expecting 
a right to privacy after you™ve been told in a 
policy you have no privacy
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose we find a right of privacy
 Is that the end of the case? I mean, wouldn't you also -- in order to sustain this lawsuit, wouldn't 
you also have to find that it was an unreasonable --MR
 KATYAL: Absolutely
 There are two arrows in the city's quiver, and I think they're right 
as to both of them
 But --JUSTICE SCALIA: What™s the government's position on the unreasonableness of the search? MR
 KATYAL: The government's position is that the Ninth Circuit just from the get-go got the 
 standard wrong by citing -- by using a Schowengerdt test 
which was, was this -- was this search the least 
restrictive alternative? And we think this Court has repeatedly said that's the wrong way of thinking about 
it, that that puts judges in the position of 
second-guessing searches on the ground, that they™re 
not really fully -- fully equipped to do so
 So I do think that is a possible way to resolve this, Justice Scalia, but --JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe an easier way, huh? MR
 KATYAL: Well, I don't know that it's easier, in the following sense: I think that thousands of employers across the country rely on these policies 
and millions of employees
 And the Ninth Circuit's decision puts that reliance in some jeopardy, because it 
said that you can have an official policy and it can be 
taken back by what some ad hoc subordinate says
 And that is, I think, a very destructive notion to the idea 
of reliance on these policies and setting --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your -- your position would require people basically to have two of 
these things with them, two whatever they are, 
text messager or the BlackBerries or whatever, right? 
Because assuming they™re going to get personal things, 
you know, some emergency at home, they™re also going to  
 get work things --MR
 KATYAL: To the -- under this policy, yes
 You might have an employer that sets a different policy and allows for some de minimis use and a zone of 
privacy in that use
 You can have a variety of different things
 But what I think would be dangerous is to have a blanket rule that constitutionalizes and 
says you always have reasonable expectations of privacy 
in this technology
 The result may be, Mr
 Chief Justice, that employers then won't give that 
technology at all to their employees and -- and 
eliminate even that de minimis use
 Mr
 Chief Justice, you had also asked before about the standpoint of Quon in -- in evaluating 
the reasonableness of the search -- of the search in his 
perspective of the policy
 We think that is the wrong way of looking at it
 Instead, we think the proper test is the written policy, what it says, and that is the 
simplest way, I think, to provided administrability to 
the lower courts
 They can simply say was this policy in existence, and not get into those questions of is it 
like a parking ticket, did I flip through it too 
quickly, did I understand that the policy and the like
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You want to -- you want to -- you want to undo O'Connor's operational realities  
 of the workplace and say the minute you issued a written 
policy that renders all searches okay, even if the 
operational realities are different? MR
 KATYAL: Not at all, Justice Sotomayor
 I take it the language about operational realities in 
the workplace, what is right next to it is looking to 
whether or not there are regulations in place, and here 
a policy is a regulation
 And so --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You may have an argument that the nature of the policy here and all of the 
activities related to it don't prove an operational 
reality of privacy, but I don't know why -- you want a 
flat rule that says once you have a written policy, 
there™ no expectation of privacy
 MR
 KATYAL: And I think that is -- that is what O'Connor says with respect to the -- as long as the 
policy is in place, that -- that's what O'Connor 
permits
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 Mr
 Dammeier
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DIETER DAMMEIER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS MR
 DAMMEIER: Thank you, Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think an underlying fact that we might be  
 skipping over is -- is -- and both the lower courts 
recognize this -- that the computer policy that the 
department had didn't apply to the pagers on its own
 
It -- it only came into play after Lieutenant Duke 
modified that policy and told people at the -- at the 
meeting that was referred to earlier that the pagers are 
now going to be applying with -- with this policy
 
It -- it --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is -- why is that so? I mean, it did say associated equipment
 And -- and if an employee is told now e-mails aren't private, so we™re 
warning you, we can monitor them, wouldn't such an 
employee expect the same thing to apply to the pager? MR
 DAMMEIER: Well, the policy itself has two components to it
 One is, don't use our equipment, all associated equipment for personal business
 The other part of that policy deals with the no privacy, and it informs the people there could be 
monitoring
 And specifically on the acknowledgment form of that policy, which is at Appendix  of the 
petition, it specifically says the city will 
periodically monitor e-mail, Internet use, and computer 
usage
 And -- and, again, I think this is why the --both lower courts came to the conclusion that the  
 computer policy on its own wasn't in play until 
Lieutenant Duke announced that, hey, now the pagers are 
going -- are going to be in play with this computer 
policy
 This is the same Lieutenant Duke --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But my question is, an employee reads this policy and says, oh, my e-mails are 
going to be subject to being monitored --MR
 DAMMEIER: Sure
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't that employee expect that the policy would carry over to pagers? I mean, would -- when you think of what's the reason why they want 
to look at the e-mails, wouldn't the same reason apply? MR
 DAMMEIER: Well, I'm sure the same reasons could apply, but the -- the city is the one that 
writes the rules here
 The -- if they want to make it clear on what it applies to, it certainly should be on 
them to write them clear so the employee understands
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe -- maybe everybody else knows this, but what is the difference 
between a pager and e-mail? MR
 DAMMEIER: Sure
 The e-mail, looking at the computer policy -- that goes through the city's 
computer, it goes through the city's server, it goes 
through all the equipment that -- that has -- that the 
city can easily monitor
 Here the pagers are a separate  
 device that goes home with you, that travels with you, 
that you can use on duty, off duty, and --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can do that with e-mails
 MR
 DAMMEIER: Certainly, certainly
 But in this -- in this -- in this instance with the pagers, it went 
through no city equipment; it went through Arch Wireless 
and then was transmitted to another -- another person
 So, again, to Duke -- Duke is the one that said: Hey, this -- this comes into play
 But Lieutenant Duke is also the one that gave the privacy 
guarantee to the SWAT team members and said: As long as you pay the overages, we™re not going to look at your 
pagers; we're not going to look at the messages
 So if -- if you couple both of those modifications, both by 
the same lieutenant -- and he wasn't just some 
subordinate; he was the lieutenant in charge of the 
administrative bureau; he was the administrative bureau 
commander
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that he said --he was saying: But as far as billing is concerned, I'm not going to look at these; if you use more than , 
characters, you pay the extra, and that will be the end 
of it
 If you contest that, then I™ll look to see whether those in excess of , characters were for  
 work purposes or private purposes
 And so he's talking about the billing
 He hasn't retracted what was said at the meeting about -- that 
these text messages are subject to audit
 MR
 DAMMEIER: This -- this is what Sergeant Quon testified to, that he attributed to Lieutenant 
Duke: If you don't want us to read it, pay the overage fee
 JUSTICE BREYER: But what™s wrong with his deciding: I don't like to do this anymore? I don't want to collect all this money; it's too complicated; 
and so I don't know how many of these messages are 
related to work and how many they are just mucking 
around prying into each other's business
 MR
 DAMMEIER: He can certainly --JUSTICE BREYER: So I would like to know, so therefore I'm going to look and see
 Now, what™s unreasonable about that? MR
 DAMMEIER: Well, he certainly could say I don't want to do this anymore, and he could --JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no
 MR
 DAMMEIER: And he could tell everybody
 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm saying what's -- the city owns the pager
 It's a pager used for work
 They are giving a privilege to people if they want to  
 use it off work
 It seems to be involving a big amount of collection, and so what he wants to do is he wants to 
see how much of this is being used for work and how much 
is of this not being used for work
 My question, which I just repeated, is why is that an unreasonable thing? MR
 DAMMEIER: I don't think that request is unreasonable, Your Honor
 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine
 And then if that™s not unreasonable, why is what went on here that is 
any different? MR
 DAMMEIER: Well, here the jury -- the only fact that was determined by the jury was the reason 
for the search
 And that's found at the appendix to the petition page 
 This is the only finding that the jury made as to the purpose of the search: To determine the efficacy of the existing character limits to ensure 
that officers were not being required to pay for the 
work-related expenses
 JUSTICE BREYER: How does that differ from what I just said? MR
 DAMMEIER: Well, it -- it comes into play on -- on the scope of the search
 Again --JUSTICE BREYER: No, I understand
 I thought it's just a more -- a few more words to say just what I  
 said
 That they wanted to look into this because they are tired about collecting so much money
 It's the third time I've said the same thing; probably it's my fault I™m not being clear
 But it looked as if they wanted to know how many are being 
sent for work purposes, how many for private purposes 
including prying into people's business, which wasn't 
too desirable, and -- and -- so that they could get 
the -- the charges right
 Now, that sounds like what the jury said they were doing, too
 And my question was -- I don't see anything, quite honestly, unreasonable about that, where 
you™re the employer, where it's a SWAT team, where --
where -- where you™re paying for this in the first 
place
 So the reason I ask it is I would like you clearly to explain what's unreasonable about it
 MR
 DAMMEIER: The scope of the search was unreasonable
 JUSTICE BREYER: That's the conclusion
 Now, what's your reason? MR
 DAMMEIER: Under -- under -- looking at O'Connor, you have to -- you have to look to make sure 
that the search is not excessively intrusive
 Here, what they did was they took all the messages and started 
reading them
 Given the purpose, the limited purpose  
 that was found by the jury for the search, they didn't 
need to do that
 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, explain that one to me
 MR
 DAMMEIER: They --JUSTICE BREYER: Being naive about this, if I had a -- like, , , characters in , messages 
and I wanted to know which are personal and which are 
work-related, a good way to get at least a good first 
cut would be to read them
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE BREYER: Okay? So I start off thinking that seems to be reasonable to me
 That's what I would do
 MR
 DAMMEIER: Well, that's certainly one --JUSTICE BREYER: So all right
 Now you tell me why that isn't reasonable
 MR
 DAMMEIER: That's one of the ways they could have done it
 They could have got -- they could have got consent from the officers first to do it
 They could have had the officers themselves count the 
messages
 After all, the officers were the ones that were paying for the overages
 JUSTICE BREYER: All right
 But the officers might say: I don't want you to read these  
 messages because they happen to be about the sexual 
activity of some of my coworkers and their wives and me, 
which happened to be the case here
 MR
 DAMMEIER: Right
 JUSTICE BREYER: So I guess if you had asked for consent, the officer would have said no
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE BREYER: Now, he says, I still want to know
 I will be repeating it
 All right
 So what -- that didn't sound very practical
 What's the other way? MR
 DAMMEIER: Well, they could have -- they could have had the officers themselves count the 
messages
 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the officer is going to say, hey, these are all big -- work-related
 I™ll tell you that
 I only had two
 MR
 DAMMEIER: Well --(Laughter
) JUSTICE BREYER: Okay
 What's a third way? MR
 DAMMEIER: Okay
 They -- the lieutenant could have said, hey, we're going to stop this practice 
that I started, and from this month forward make sure 
all you do is business-related
 No more --JUSTICE BREYER: That would have been rough on them
 Because you want to let them have a few; you  
 need pizza when you™re out on duty
 You want to -- there are --MR
 DAMMEIER: The --JUSTICE BREYER: Look, so far I listened to four things, and I'm just being naive about it
 I™ll read it more closely, but I don't see why these four things are 
so obviously more reasonable than what they did
 MR
 DAMMEIER: They also -- they could have had the officers redact the private messages and then 
given it -- given it to the department
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But suppose that their application of what -- how much was being spent on 
business-related, all of your suggestions about having 
the officer do things does nothing about their application
 MR
 DAMMEIER: Well --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You™re -- you™re relying on the very person you™re auditing to do the 
audit for you
 That doesn't seem either practical or business-wise
 MR
 DAMMEIER: Well, other than my one sample of -- example of saying, hey, let's -- let's stop 
the personal use and we™re going to have a test month 
to determine exactly how many messages we need for our 
business-related purposes
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That goes back to -- I  
 don't understand that
 You™re still relying on the person you™re auditing to say to you I™m only using 
it for business
 That -- that's just not logical
 MR
 DAMMEIER: Well, but the -- the sole purpose of the search was only to find out if officers 
were paying for business-related messages that they 
didn't need to pay for
 JUSTICE BREYER: But the question, in the Constitution, the word is "unreasonable
" Is it a reasonable or unreasonable? So the question -- what I asked is not maybe you would have gotten a better result 
if you had hired Bain Associates and Bain would have 
done a -month study at a cost of $,
 But I could say a person who doesn't want to hire Bain and who doesn't want to rely on the 
unverified word of the officers who were using these for 
God knows what is not being unreasonable
 That's the ultimate issue
 And that's why I™m putting it to you to show me that what they did was unreasonable
 MR
 DAMMEIER: I think it comes down from that perspective on the excessiveness of the search
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The only reason --the only reason the officer would not be accurate -- I 
mean, I don't understand why the redaction is such a bad 
idea
 He just says these are private
 And that allows  
 -- and then you could look at everything else
 You can see if he's going too far because then everything else 
would be there
 But in terms of -- the jury found this was not done to find out what was in the messages, so 
they don't need to find out what™s in the messages
 
That's just a question
 He has to pay for everything he -- he redacts
 MR
 DAMMEIER: That -- that's exactly what we™re saying
 I mean, the interest here is -- is for the officer to be upfront as far as what™s 
business-related to -- if he's paying for things that he shouldn't be paying for, I'm sure he would -- he would be 
forthright about that
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, it's no different than the police coming in and saying, well, 
we™re going to look at, you know, what's in every drawer 
and then -- you know, then if it turns out to be 
personal and private, we won't -- you know, we won't --
it just happens that we came upon, I guess, is 
Justice Kennedy's point
 It's kind of the plain view doctrine, except they get to decide how broad what they 
can view is
 MR
 DAMMEIER: That's true
 I agree with that
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you this question  
 about the basic background of a reasonable expectation 
of privacy? This is SWAT team work
 Supposing it was an officer answering  calls or things like that
 Isn't there sort of a background expectation that sooner or 
later, somebody might have to look at communications for 
this particular kind of law enforcement officer? MR
 DAMMEIER: Well, certainly -- certainly that could happen in any number of --JUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, wouldn't you just assume that that whole universe of conversations by SWAT 
officers who are on duty / might well have to be 
reviewed by some member of the public or some of their 
superiors? MR
 DAMMEIER: But that -- that could be a possibility on any -- on anything that they do in their 
lives, whether it be their personal life or --JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but it's over official -- it's over the official communications 
equipment that they use for purposes of law enforcement
 MR
 DAMMEIER: Correct
 Correct
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I certainly -- criminal defense attorneys challenging probable cause would want 
to look at these
 They would want to see if there is exonerating evidence, under the rule that all 
exonerating evidence has to be submitted
 It would seem  
 to me that it's quite likely, as Justice Stevens' 
question indicates, that there is going to -- that these 
are going to be discoverable
 MR
 DAMMEIER: Well, it's just like my mail that I might send out to somebody
 It might be discoverable in litigation, but that doesn't --JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you™re not -- you™re not a police officer who is making arrests
 I mean, this -- this is part and parcel of determining probable 
cause and mitigating evidence
 MR
 DAMMEIER: No, it -- obviously, there are different reasons that could come into play that 
would legally produce these messages, certainly
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr
 Dammeier, you could say the same thing about private phones
 There are obviously circumstances in which whether you were making 
a call between certain times becomes relevant to 
litigation
 So you could say that destroys the expectation of privacy? I'm not sure
 I hope we don't say that
 MR
 DAMMEIER: No
 No
 It's like -- this -- in O'Connor, all nine Justices in O'Connor found an 
expectation of privacy in Dr
 Ortega's desk, because 
even though it was a state-owned desk, you still have an 
expectation of privacy
  
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but there™s no normal reason for going through somebody's desk; whereas, 
there would be a very ordinary -- ordinary reason for 
reviewing calls made to the SWAT -- members of the SWAT 
team, it seems to me
 MR
 DAMMEIER: Well, there are -- as talked about in O'Connor, there are certainly a lot of valid 
reasons to go through a public employee's desk, if you™re 
looking for a file or if you™re looking for --JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes
 MR
 DAMMEIER: Or for -- or for an investigation
 But still, there was that expectation of privacy
 You™re talking about employees that -- in today's society, I think work and private life get 
melded together
 Here, we™re talking about SWAT people / --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, to say that there™s an expectation of privacy in the desk doesn't say that 
every intrusion into that expectation of privacy is an 
unreasonable one
 There could be that expectation of privacy and, still, for some reason -- let's assume there 
has been a theft in the building, and it's known that 
what was taken has not gotten out of the building
 It's conceivable that that would be a valid reason to intrude 
upon the expectation of privacy, right? 
 MR
 DAMMEIER: Correct
 I don't think we™re taking away the government's ability to do searches 
under proper circumstances
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why isn't this a proper circumstance? MR
 DAMMEIER: The initial circumstance might be proper, but how they effectuated it was not
 
It was excessively intrusive
 They did not -- the purpose was to find out if they were paying for enough 
work-related messages
 They did not need to look at these, what they knew were going to be private messages
 
They knew -- the lieutenant had this arrangement that they 
could use this for personal purposes
 They knew what they were going to be looking at
 JUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't know which ones were private messages, did they? MR
 DAMMEIER: Not until they read them
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not until they read them
 MR
 DAMMEIER: But there certainly -- they certainly knew what might be coming because of the arrangement that Lieutenant Duke had in place
 Here -- here I think that™s --
JUSTICE ALITO: What was the arrangement that Lieutenant Duke had in place? I thought all he said was: I don't have an intent to read these, 
 because it's too much trouble, so if you go over and you pay me the extra, I'm not going to read them
 MR
 DAMMEIER: His --JUSTICE ALITO: Did he ever say that -- that I'm not -- that you have a privacy right in these 
things? MR
 DAMMEIER: No, but according -- according to Sergeant Quon's testimony, he told him: As long as you pay the overages, we™re not going to read them
 And that --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did he say "we"? He -- even Quon didn't say that
 Duke said he wouldn't do it
 But earlier, the -- at the meeting, the statement was made 
that these are open to audit
 Didn't say only by Lieutenant Duke
 MR
 DAMMEIER: True
 True
 I agree
 But it was Lieutenant Duke, the one that was making the 
announcement that now these pagers are going to fall 
under the computer policy, the same lieutenant who then 
gave the assurance that as long as you pay the overages, 
we™re not -- we™re not going to look at them
 I mean, when you™re talking about the operational reality of O'Connor, that was the 
operational reality
 The SWAT members knew: As long as I pay the overages, my messages aren't going to be 
reviewed
  
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What happens, just out of curiosity, if you're -- he is on the pager and 
sending a message and they™re trying to reach him for, 
you know, a SWAT team crisis? Does he -- does the one kind of trump the other, or do they get a busy signal? MR
 DAMMEIER: I don't think that's in the record
 However, my understanding is that you would get it in between messages
 So messages are going out and coming in at the same time, pretty much
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And would you know where the message was coming from? MR
 DAMMEIER: I believe so
 It identifies where it's coming from
 It identifies the number of where it's coming from
 If you know the number, you know where it's coming from
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And he's talking with a girlfriend, and he has a voice mail saying that your 
call is very important to us; we™ll get back to you? (Laughter
) MR
 DAMMEIER: Well, I think with the text messages -- and that's what we are talking about the 
transcripts of, were the text messages that were data 
transferred from device to device, and here, you know, 
we come back to -- I did want to touch a little bit on 
the Stored Communications Act having play on somebody™s 
 expectation of privacy -- you know, it's -- lawfully, 
those messages were protected
 And I think, looking at people's expectation of privacy, that should be a 
component
 It certainly may be not the end-all to the question, but it should be a factor in determining 
whether or not there™s going to be an expectation of 
privacy
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did -- did he know about that statute? I didn't know about it
 MR
 DAMMEIER: That's not in -- that's not in the record
 That is not in the record
 But --JUSTICE SCALIA: Can we assume he didn't? MR
 DAMMEIER: Right
 Well, we can assume that, but we also --JUSTICE SCALIA: And what difference would that make? MR
 DAMMEIER: I still don't think anything, given the operational realities --JUSTICE SCALIA: I don™t see how it can affect his expectation of privacy, if he didn't even know about it
 MR
 DAMMEIER: Well, it's -- it's just like the California Public Records Act
 We should also assume he didn't know about that as well, because the --
Petitioners make an argument that because there is this 
California Public Records Act, that that may diminish  
 one's expectation of privacy
 Certainly, if we™re going to have that, then we should also be having the 
Stored Communications Act that might enhance the --JUSTICE SCALIA: Ignorance of the law is no excuse, is what you™re saying? JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any theory, or do you make any argument that Florio, Trujillo, and 
Quon's wife can succeed in their Fourth Amendment 
claims, if Quon can't? MR
 DAMMEIER: I do
 We, in our brief, try to analogize that to the mail
 I think when they sent messages to -- to Sergeant Quon, that was a letter that 
I sent
 And here, the department didn't go get that letter from Sergeant Quon after -- after delivery, 
meaning go get it from his pager
 They went to the equivalent of the Post Office, which was Arch Wireless, 
and got a copy off of their server
 So I -- I think --and, again, analogizing to the mail, they have an 
expectation of privacy while that message is in the 
course of delivery
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose it was perfectly clear that -- I mean, suppose that the department 
gave Mr
 Quon a policy -- a statement that says: Sign this, you acknowledge that your pager is to be used only  
 for work and that you have no privacy interest in it 
whatsoever; we™re going to monitor this every day
 
And then these other individuals sent him messages
 
You would still say they have an expectation 
of privacy in those messages? MR
 DAMMEIER: Until the point that it™s on Quon's pager
 I think under that scenario, that they could have obtained the messages from Quon, but they 
went over to Arch, the equivalent of the Post Office, 
and got them from them
 It's like if I -- I make a copy of a letter before I send it to somebody
 You know, down the road, I might not know what happens and I might lose my 
expectation of privacy down the road, but that copy I 
kept, I think there is still an expectation
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what -- when you send a text message to somebody else, aren't you quite aware 
that that text message will remain confidential only to 
the extent that either the recipient keeps it 
confidential -- and he can disclose it -- or somebody 
else who has power over the recipient or over the 
recipient's phone chooses to look at it? Don't -- isn't that understood when you send somebody a text message? MR
 DAMMEIER: I -- I agree with that, and --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, so she should have  
 understood that, you know, whoever could get ahold of 
his phone lawfully can read the message
 In other words, I don't see that she's in a -- in a different 
position from Quon himself
 MR
 DAMMEIER: I think it's just a slightly different one
 I mean, first of all, they didn't lawfully get it; there was a violation of the Stored 
Communications Act to get it
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's a different issue
 MR
 DAMMEIER: But here, again, had they gotten consent from -- from Quon and got it from him 
directly, that's a -- that's a different story
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, again, it depends upon their reasonable expectation
 Do any of these other people know about Arch Wireless? Don't they just assume that once they send something to Quon, it's going 
to Quon? MR
 DAMMEIER: That's -- that is true
 I mean, they expect --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then they can't have a reasonable expectation of privacy based on 
the fact that their communication is routed through a 
communications company
 MR
 DAMMEIER: Well, they -- they expect  
 that some company, I'm sure, is going to have to be 
processing the delivery of this message
 And --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I didn't -- I wouldn't think that
 I thought, you know, you push a button; it goes right to the other thing
 (Laughter
) MR
 DAMMEIER: Well --JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean it doesn't go right to the other thing? (Laughter
) MR
 DAMMEIER: It's -- I mean, it's like with e-mails
 When we send an e-mail, that goes through some e-mail provider, whether it be AOL or Yahoo
 It's going through some service provider
 Just like when we send a letter or package, it's going through -- some 
provider is going to move that for us, until it gets to 
the end recipient
 And like the mail, that message enjoys an expectation of privacy while it's with the Post 
Office --JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you print these things out? Could Quon print these -- these spicy conversations out and circulate them among his buddies? MR
 DAMMEIER: Well, he could have ultimately, sure
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- 
 MR
 DAMMEIER: And -- and like, when I get a piece of mail from somebody, I could do that as well, 
but that doesn't mean that the government gets to go to 
the Post Office and get my mail before I get it
 I think -- I think that, you know, certainly adds a little 
bit to the correspondence that dealt with --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But just -- just to be clear: You think if these messages went straight to Quon that there™d be no problem from the point of 
view of the senders? I mean, no problem in searching --getting them from Quon? MR
 DAMMEIER: I think it's certainly a harder argument for me to make --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes
 MR
 DAMMEIER: -- that they have an expectation after -- after Quon has it
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we have to assume for your argument to succeed that they know that this goes 
somewhere else and then it™s processed and then it goes 
to Quon
 MR
 DAMMEIER: Yes, but I think in today's -- I think in today's society that's -- that's a 
reasonable assumption to make
 One --JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I didn't know
 MR
 DAMMEIER: I think it might have been 
 Florio testified that she actually called her carrier to 
find out, you know, if -- if the messages that she would 
transmit would be maintained and that was -- that they 
didn't maintain a copy
 So there was some understanding of how the process worked
 JUSTICE ALITO: Can an officer who has one of these pagers delete messages from the pager --MR
 DAMMEIER: Yes
 JUSTICE ALITO: -- so that they can't be recovered by the department if the pager is turned into 
the department? MR
 DAMMEIER: Sure
 Yes
 JUSTICE ALITO: They can delete them? MR
 DAMMEIER: They can delete them
 Just like if they received a letter, they could be put in the 
shredder
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose I sent somebody a letter and -- and I have privacy in that letter, and 
let's assume it™s intercepted at the Post Office, but I 
have also published the letter in a letter to the editor 
of the newspaper
 I have written the following letter to Sergeant Quon
 Do I still have a right -- a right of privacy in that letter? MR
 DAMMEIER: Well, I think then certainly your expectation may be diminished
  
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that's the situation here
 The -- the central location that stores the message is one thing, but she's made -- made the 
message public effectively by sending it to Quon
 Once it gets to Quon, she knows that Quon can make it public 
or that the employer can -- can find out about it
 MR
 DAMMEIER: But that would create a free-for-all in service providers
 If -- if while this message, after it™s sent and it™s in transit --JUSTICE SCALIA: Right
 MR
 DAMMEIER: It's a free-for-all
 The government could just go in and --JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly
 That -- and that's why you have the statute, because the Fourth 
Amendment wouldn't solve the problem, because you are 
effectively making it public by sending it to somebody 
whom you don't know is immune from disclosure
 So, in order to stop the intermediary from making it public, 
you needed the statute
 Otherwise you wouldn't need it; the Fourth Amendment would solve the problem, right? MR
 DAMMEIER: Well, certainly, obviously the statute could come into play in addition to the 
Fourth Amendment
 But here, you know, I come back to the mail analogy
 Just because at the end of the line somebody might disseminate my letter doesn't lose an 
 expectation in the copy that I make that I may keep or 
that in the course of delivery the Post Office might 
keep
 I still enjoy an expectation -- and the Fourth Amendment certainly protects that copy, that either I 
kept or the Post Office is keeping in the course of 
delivery
 Certainly, at the end of the line, that letter could be published to the world, but that's not the same 
thing as the government coming in and getting a copy of 
it while it was being delivered
 JUSTICE ALITO: Are you sure that -- are you sure about your answer to the question of deletion? 
It's not like deleting something from a computer which 
doesn't really delete it from the computer? MR
 DAMMEIER: Honestly, I'm not -- that's not in the record, and the -- how that pager works as 
far as deleting, I couldn't be certain that it would be 
deleted forever
 I would certainly not
 One -- one of the points to -- to raise, too, was that most of these texts took place off duty 
when dealing with Sergeant Quon
 So, again, back to looking at the actual practice that O'Connor has us look 
at, you know, here again --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought the factual record was the opposite, that in fact most of the calls  
 were -- not most, but a huge number of calls were 
happening on duty
 MR
 DAMMEIER: There were -- there were a large number on-duty
 I think it was broken down to where the average was  in a work shift and the most on 
one day was 
 But also they talked about -- they took about  seconds
 So you™re talking about an average of about  minutes during -- during a work day
 But the testimony of Sergeant Quon was that most of these were actually off-duty
 And, you know, I certainly -- I think that should come into play, given 
the department -- they gave them pagers
 And it wasn't a one-way use; it wasn't, hey, this is, you know, for the 
benefit of the employee
 The department received a benefit
 I mean, they wanted to be able to have these SWAT guys 
show up quickly, respond quickly, and there was a mix on 
-- on the reasons for these pagers
 The exchange was, we™re going to let you use these for personal purposes, and given that reality, 
you should be able to have some -- some expectation of 
privacy in that use
 It's like if I pick up a phone and I'm a public employee and I call my wife, I should be 
able to have some expectation of privacy in a 
conversation, especially given, you know -- you talk 
about guys that are on /
 Do they have no private  
 life, now? Do they not have --JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the policy was limited personal use
 MR
 DAMMEIER: The computer policy was limited personal use
 Again, depending on how that comes into play with what Lieutenant Duke --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the notice was we™re going to treat these just like e-mails, and 
e-mails were limited personal use
 MR
 DAMMEIER: Correct
 With -- with the additional modification by -- by Duke, that you could 
also use them for personal purposes, from day one when 
the pagers were issued
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 MR
 DAMMEIER: Thank you
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr
 Richland, you have  minutes remaining
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L
 RICHARDS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS MR
 RICHLAND: Thank you
 I would first like to just make it clear that what it is being claimed 
was the guarantee of privacy by Lieutenant Duke is 
really absolutely not that at all
 And I would refer the Court to Joint Appendix page , which does summarize 
that, and it says -- here is what precisely what  
 Lieutenant Duke said: "Because of the overage Lieutenant Duke went to Sergeant Quon and told him the 
city-issued two-way pagers were considered e-mail and 
could be audited
" So that's what he said first
 Then he said -- he told Sergeant Quon it was not his -- his intent to audit employees' text messages 
to see if the overages were due to work-related 
transmissions
 He advised Sergeant Quon he, Sergeant Quon, could reimburse the city for the overages so he, Duke, 
would not have to audit the transmission and see how 
many messages were non-work-related
 Lieutenant Duke told Sergeant Quon he is doing this because if anybody 
wished to challenge their overage, he could audit the 
text transmissions to verify how many were 
non-work-related, and then, finally, Lieutenant Duke 
added, the text messages were considered public records 
and could be audited at any time
 That is what is being characterized as a guarantee of privacy
 It's hard to see how that in any way undercuts the official written policy
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr
 Richland, do you take any position on whether Jerilyn Quon, April Florio, and 
Steve Trujillo stand in the same position as Sergeant 
Quon insofar as this lawsuit is concerned?  
 MR
 RICHLAND: We do, with respect -- in at least one respect, and that is: If Sergeant Quon loses, then we think the other plaintiffs must also lose
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? MR
 RICHLAND: Yes
 The reason for that is that this Court has held on many occasions that, once 
one has sent a communication or an object to another 
person, they lose their expectation of privacy in --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That means the government can set up an interception mechanism on 
telephone transmissions, on e-mail, computer 
transmissions --MR
 RICHLAND: It -- it does not mean that, Justice Sotomayor
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If it doesn't mean that, answer his argument that, yes, you could take anything 
from Quon, but the storage -- you went to the storage 
facility, which is a Post Office
 MR
 RICHLAND: And he says it's a Post Office, but the truth is that all of these plaintiffs 
admitted that they knew that this was a 
department-issued pager, and this wasn't a Post Office
 
Arch Wireless was the department's agent
 These text messages were being sent to someplace
 Both the written policy and the oral policy 
 discriminate on the basis of status or belief
 That's what the policy says I just read
 It doesn't say you can; it says you can't
 MR
 McCONNELL: It's that the group may not confine its leadership based upon its beliefs
 That means that --JUSTICE BREYER: That's what you say, but that's not what the policy says
 The policy says that you have to let everybody in, regardless of their status or belief
 MR
 McCONNELL: Right
 And -- and our view is that the status --JUSTICE BREYER: So you cannot discriminate on the basis of status or belief
 MR
 McCONNELL: The status half of that is perfectly constitutional and --JUSTICE SCALIA: You say you --MR
 McCONNELL: -- the belief half of that is not
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- you have to -- you have to let these organizations discriminate on the basis of belief
 And they say: No, we don't want to; that's too complicated for us to figure out which ones we should, which ones we shouldn't
 We'd rather let them work off-campus
 We just don't want to get into this business
 It's not just against religion
 It might be  
 against a Turkish-speaking society that thinks Turkish 
is extremely important to speak or a chess club that 
thinks the same
 It could be a lot of people
 Now, why do you -- what's wrong with us, a First Amendment -- an organization itself affected with First 
Amendment interests, saying we just don't want to have 
those on campus organizations, too much trouble
 MR
 McCONNELL: What is -- what is wrong with that is that restrictions on a designated public forum must 
be reasonable in light of the purposes of the forum
 The purpose of the forum is set forth in Joint Stipulation 
Number 
 It is to promote a diversity of viewpoints among registered student organizations
 If the student organizations are not allowed to have a coherent set of 
beliefs, there can be no diversity among them
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this sounds like a debate over whether the policy as the school believes it 
should be implemented is not a good one
 But isn't that their choice? Don't we give deference to an educational institution in terms of the choices it makes about 
effecting its own -- its purposes? And the purpose here is we don't want our students to discriminate
 MR
 McCONNELL: There is a stipulation as to what the purpose is, and the purpose is to promote a 
diversity of viewpoints among registered student  
 organizations
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And is --JUSTICE BREYER: That's their way of doing that
 MR
 McCONNELL: It is a stipulated fact
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And Hastings takes the position that it's all in favor of diversity, not only among the groups but within the groups
 So --MR
 McCONNELL: Which is not the joint stipulation
 The stipulation is that the purpose of the forum is diversity among groups
 Their policy is not --it's not only just unreasonable in light of it; it is contrary to it
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It is that they --MR
 McCONNELL: It defeats the purpose of the forum
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They say, yes, we believe in diversity among groups, but we also believe in diversity within the group; that's a good thing
 They are not backing off from: We think diversity among groups is fine
 MR
 McCONNELL: They say that in their brief, but that is not the stipulated fact in the 
case
 JUSTICE BREYER: Let me make an imaginary example, and that™s --JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is the  
 stipulation? MR
 McCONNELL: It's page  in the Joint Appendix, Joint Stipulation Number 
 It is the only stipulation in the case having to do with what the 
purpose is of the RSO forum
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute now
 A diversity --MR
 McCONNELL: "Hastings seeks to promote a diversity of viewpoints among registered student 
organizations
" And note how destructive an all-comers policy directed on belief is toward -- toward that
 
That means that if, for example, there™s an NAACP 
chapter, it would have to allow a -- a racist skinhead 
to sit on -- in on its planning meetings
 That means that if there™s an environmentalist club that has a 
demonstration in Sacramento in favor of cap-and-trade 
legislation, they would have to allow --JUSTICE GINSBURG: It may be --MR
 McCONNELL: -- a global warming skeptic to --JUSTICE GINSBURG: It may be an ill-advised policy, but the school says: It's our policy
 It's working fine, and all the -- the hypotheticals about 
sabotage, takeover, they haven't happened
  
 MR
 McCONNELL: They haven't happened because this policy came into being -- was announced for 
the first time in 
 So there couldn't possibly be any -- any record of that
 JUSTICE SCALIA: This -- this was not the policy on the basis of which CLS was excluded; is that 
correct? MR
 McCONNELL: That's correct, it was not
 JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- when they were refused participation in the -- in the student 
organization program, they were not told about the 
all-comers policy
 MR
 McCONNELL: That's correct
 Joint Stipulation Number  states clearly that the -- that the 
-- that they were informed, and I quote: "They were informed that CLS bylaws were not compliant with the 
religion and sexual orientation provisions of the 
Nondiscrimination Policy
" JUSTICE ALITO: And was there any written document memorializing this policy prior to the time 
when the former dean gave her deposition? MR
 McCONNELL: Never
 And --JUSTICE ALITO: And is the -- is the policy as articulated by the dean in her deposition the same as 
the policy that Hastings now claims it has in its brief? 
 MR
 McCONNELL: I don't think so
 Every time the policy is mentioned, it seems to morph into 
something else
 When the dean announced it at the deposition, she said all students may participate on 
the -- in all activities, period, full stop
 Now we find out in their brief, well, their -- groups can have 
conduct limitations, they can require dues, they can 
have attendance requirements, they can have competitive 
contests to see whether they get in
 This -- this policy is -- it changes with every wind
 And -- but the fundamental problem with this -- with this is what -- what this Court stated in 
Velazquez v
 Legal Services Corporation, that you cannot 
allow -- you cannot allow the terms of the policy just 
to say that whatever their policy is, that that 
determines the contours of the program, because that 
would render the First Amendment a -- a nullity
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, that was not a religion case
 Your argument at its most fundamental level is that religious organizations are different 
because religion is all about belief
 But at that point don't we also have a tradition of separation? That's the whole reason why church and state for many purposes 
are kept separate, so that States are not implicated 
 with religious beliefs
 And it -- it -- it seems to me we have to consider that when we are considering your argument
 
Now, you can cite Rosenberger, but -- but I think this is 
different from that
 MR
 McCONNELL: The separation is between church and state, but this Court has held over and over 
again that speech forums -- that people participating in 
a speech forum are not the state
 The state is Hastings
 We are perfectly private
 There is nothing wrong with a religious organization, even on public --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You™re not --JUSTICE SCALIA: Anyway, as I understand your argument on the all-comers policy, it is not an 
argument that -- that is based upon the religious nature 
of CLS
 You would make the same argument of unconstitutionality with respect to the student 
Republican Club, wouldn't you? MR
 McCONNELL: We would
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or --MR
 McCONNELL: Now, we do --there is in addition a free exercise argument, but I 
don't -- but in this case what the Free Exercise Clause 
protects is exactly what the associational freedom test 
would protect for everyone
 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I had thought that an important part of the case, of your case, is that belief 
is inherent to the idea of religious expression and must 
be protected
 But if the protection causes problems within the school for other policies, then doesn't the 
separation policy come into play? That's -- that's what I'm asking
 MR
 McCONNELL: Again, separation does not apply to private parties when they are operating, even 
on government property
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 McConnell, let's say it is the belief of this group, based on their reading 
of the Bible, that only white men can lead the Bible 
studies, can become officers of the group, and that's 
based on their fundamental belief that that's what the 
Bible instructs
 On your view, must Hastings give this organization status as a recognized student 
organization? MR
 McCONNELL: No, Justice Ginsburg
 Our position is it is unconstitutional to -- to prohibit 
groups to form around beliefs but not around status
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the belief is -- this is the belief
 MR
 McCONNELL: They can insist that -- that everyone who participates in the group have that belief, 
 and that, as Justice Scalia said, may mean it's going to 
be a very small group
 But they cannot discriminate on the basis of status
 But belief -- as this Court said in Cantwell v
 Connecticut, belief, the freedom to 
believe, is absolute
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, they -- they would have to negate their belief in their practice
 They could believe this, but they couldn't implement it? MR
 McCONNELL: Well, it's not unusual to say people -- people can believe in all kinds of things 
that are illegal
 That doesn't mean that they can do them
 It's not a -- it's not an unfamiliar distinction in our law
 But let's look at --JUSTICE SCALIA: This was the basis -- your distinction between status and belief was the basis for 
your saying that the original policy, whatever --
whatever we call it -- what is the name of it? MR
 McCONNELL: The written policy? JUSTICE SCALIA: The written policy -- when it forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation was complied with by CLS because it would 
not discriminate on the basis of orientation, only on 
the basis of belief
 MR
 McCONNELL: That's correct
 JUSTICE BREYER: If -- if a homosexual 
 person said, I want to belong to this club, and I 
believe in its principles, I don't believe in sexual 
relationships before marriage, and that's why I want to 
work for homosexual marriage, which I do, so my 
consistency there, is that person -- I am consistent in 
what I work for, what I believe, and on -- as far as 
premarital sex is concerned, it's totally  percent 
with your organization that you are representing; would 
they admit that person or not? MR
 McCONNELL: Yes
 There™s a joint stipulation to that effect, Number 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: CLS doesn't have any -- any belief that marriage is between a man and a woman? MR
 McCONNELL: It -- it does
 I thought that Justice Breyer posited the case of a person of 
homosexual orientation who shares that belief
 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, no
 JUSTICE BREYER: He shares the belief that there should be no premarital sex --JUSTICE SCALIA: But he wants to marry --JUSTICE BREYER: -- and he says that's why I am working for Proposition  or whatever the 
proposition, or against it --MR
 McCONNELL: Oh, oh, I'm sorry, Justice Breyer -- 
 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm working to legalize homosexual marriage in which --MR
 McCONNELL: I'm sorry
 I misunderstood your question
 This is a religious group
 Their understanding of marriage is based upon their --JUSTICE BREYER: So they would not -- the answer is no, that person --MR
 McCONNELL: Not if that person was engaging in sexual conduct that is contrary to the --JUSTICE BREYER: No, he's not --MR
 McCONNELL: Well, in that --JUSTICE BREYER: -- because his sexual conduct --MR
 McCONNELL: -- or -- I'm sorry
 Or --JUSTICE BREYER: -- he will refrain until marriage is made lawful --MR
 McCONNELL: Right
 JUSTCIE BREYER: -- at which point he intends to engage in sexual conduct
 MR
 McCONNELL: That's right
 If the person --JUSTICE BREYER: That person
 MR
 McCONNELL: Regardless of what he intends to do, if he does not agree with the -- the 
organization on the point of -- of marriage, then he can 
 be -- he can be excluded from leadership in the group
 Again, he's able to attend all the activities
 CLS has all of its activities entirely open to everyone
 And what it objects to is having -- is being run by non-Christians, because after all, this is 
a group whose very purpose is --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You keep talking about being forced to let people in
 And this is where I'm a little bit confused by your yellow brief
 The school has taken the position that any group can apply to use its facilities; priority and 
funding, et cetera, will only go to recognized student 
groups
 But your group is not being excluded or ostracized completely from the school
 Presumably, you can meet in the cafeteria
 You can meet in open spaces in the school
 You can apply like everyone else, any other nonstudent group, recognized student group
 But you have been saying repeatedly in your presentation 
that you're barred from the campus
 And so I'm a little confused as to exactly --MR
 McCONNELL: What I -- Justice Sotomayor, I believe what we consistently say is that we have been 
denied the right to meet on campus
 And that is completely true
 Look -- if you would look at Joint Stipulation Number , at the top of page , it provides 
 that CLS, although not currently registered, is eligible 
to apply for permission for rooms
 But there is no stipulation that that will ever be granted, and the 
record shows that every time CLS has requested 
permission to meet they have gotten a complete 
run-around
 They have been told: Well, you have to apply through your lawyer, and then their -- they don't 
get an answer on time and when they get an answer it's, 
well, because you™re not a registered student group --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But let's -- could we --MR
 McCONNELL: -- there is not room for you
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's -- let's assume, because I'm not quite sure what the record is on these 
issues -- I'm somewhat confused on the factual assumptions 
underlying this case
 But let's assume two things: One, that in fact you have the option of applying for use of 
the space and that, assuming there are no conflicts and 
other things that -- that are in the normal course would 
preclude your use, that you would be granted use
 Is your argument different in that situation? MR
 McCONNELL: Justice Sotomayor, even the access to campus communications is absolutely essential, 
as this Court said in the -- in Healy v
 James
 We are barred from access to the -- to Hastings' e-mail system; 
 we can't post notices on the usual bulletin board; we 
are left out of the weekly --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There are bulletin boards
 There are other ones
 MR
 McCONNELL: There -- there™s -- there are ones for the -- for campus and student groups, and 
there™s another one for community groups
 We™re allowed to post on the community group, but we™re not 
allowed to post on the boards that -- that students look 
to for where student activities occur
 We are left out of the -- a very important point -- the student organization fair at the beginning 
of the year where groups introduce themselves to the 
One L's as they -- as they come in
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you disputing that this is --MR
 McCONNELL: We're -- we're barred from that
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you disputing this is a limited forum, public forum? MR
 McCONNELL: No, it's definitely a limited designated public forum
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's different from Cantwell
 Cantwell is where the Jehovah's Witness plays the record on the -- on the street
 And -- and -- 
 MR
 McCONNELL: I only cite Cantwell for the proposition that belief is absolute
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No
 No
 And Cantwell said that belief is central to -- to religions and that 
people would disagree
 But that's precisely why Hastings might argue to us that -- that this is 
inconsistent with their idea of what this forum is
 And if -- will you just address that, please? MR
 McCONNELL: I would address it
 The forum -- the purposes of the forum are undisputed
 They are to provide a diversity of expression among student 
groups
 Their policy disserves the purpose of the forum and therefore cannot be regarded as reasonable in light 
of that
 And what is more, what they have done is --it's also not reasonable because it's independently 
unconstitutional
 What they have done is they've said you may not have fundamental freedom of association or, 
if you do, we will withdraw an otherwise available 
benefit from you
 As recently as the unanimous decision of this Court in FAIR v
 Rumsfeld, the Court reiterated the 
-- the now I think -year old principle that 
constitutional rights may not be penalized by the 
withdrawal of benefits any more than they can by -- by 
direct prohibition
 
 I see that my white light is up, and I™d like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr
 McConnell
 Mr
 Garre
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G
 GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS MR
 GARRE: Thank you, Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case was decided by both courts below on the premise, which is not disputed at any point in the petition for certiorari, that Hastings reserves the funding and benefits that go to student groups that 
obtain school recognition to groups that choose to admit all students CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why do you have --MR
 GARRE: -- regardless of their status or their beliefs
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you have a policy, a written policy -- you don't have a written policy that says 
anything about all-comers
 You™ve got a written policy that says you can -- you can't discriminate on the basis of only one type of belief, religious belief
 MR
 GARRE: Mr
 Chief Justice, first of all, 
 this is a case about injunctive relief
 As a matter of law, the only policy that™s relevant is the current 
policy, and that's the one --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why is --MR
 GARRE: -- that both sides agree is in place
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this nondiscrimination policy no longer on the books? MR
 GARRE: No
 It™s -- it's the way in which Hastings implements the nondiscrimination policy in this 
particular forum
 And, again, look at the Ninth Circuit decision in this case
 It™s --JUSTICE SCALIA: That is not an implementation of the nondiscrimination policy
 I mean, the two policies are quite different
 Now, are you telling us that the written policy is no longer 
operative? MR
 GARRE: No, it -- Justice Scalia, this is --JUSTICE SCALIA: No, what? No, it's not operative or no, you™re not telling me that? (Laughter
) MR
 GARRE: It is operative
 This -- the all-comers policy is how it's implemented in this 
context
 And the written policy applies not only to the 
 enumerated characteristics; it applies to any arbitrary 
unreasonable discrimination, and the law school --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it doesn't --it doesn't say that
 MR
 GARRE: It does, Your Honor
 It says in the first paragraph on -- this is on page  --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right
 MR
 GARRE: -- of the Joint Appendix: The college is committed to a policy against legally 
impermissible, arbitrary, or unreasonable discriminatory 
practices
 And then it also goes on and enumerates specific factors
 And this is spelled out, I believe in page --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they -- so you™re saying the second paragraph is totally 
unnecessary
 You say the first paragraph says you can't discriminate on any basis, and the second paragraph 
spells out the bases
 So why do you do have the second paragraph? MR
 GARRE: I think it provides additional guidance
 But -- but, again, there shouldn't be any debate about what policy is at issue here
 The Ninth Circuit's decision in this case is two-sentence long
 
The first sentence describes the policy at issue in this 
case
 And it says: "The parties stipulate" -- 
 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think this case deserved a two-sentence decision in the Ninth Circuit? MR
 GARRE: Justice Alito, it was decided in the wake of the Ninth Circuit's decision in Truth, which 
had not only garnered a substantial panel decision but 
had garnered serious consideration on -- on rehearing
 
So this case, the Ninth Circuit properly concluded, was 
controlled by the Truth decision
 So in that respect --JUSTICE ALITO: So the answer is yes, this case which is -- before us has produced hundreds and hundreds of 
pages of amicus briefs, deserved two sentences in the 
court of appeals? MR
 GARRE: In the -- in the sense that it was backed up by the Truth decision, yes
 But look at the petition for certiorari in this case
 Nowhere did -- did Petitioners challenge the Ninth Circuit's 
characterization of the policy at issue
 The petition says on page  that "There are no disputed issues of 
material fact
" JUSTICE ALITO: But hasn't it been -- hasn't it been CLS's position from the very beginning of this 
case that Hastings has not in fact required every group 
to admit any student who applies? Don't they say that over and over again in their district court papers, in 
the court of appeals briefs, and in the cert petition? 
 MR
 GARRE: If -- if they believe that that caused the school to adopt a different policy, they 
shouldn't have stipulated to the policy that they did
 
And they should have challenged at a minimum --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they stipulated that the policy exists
 They didn't stipulate that it is --is being faithfully applied by Hastings
 What do you do about the -- the -- the two organizations' bylaws 
referred to in the -- in the Petitioner's brief, which 
clearly do -- conflict with the so-called all-comers 
policy? MR
 GARRE: All of the bylaws that they've pointed to, Justice Scalia --JUSTICE SCALIA: All of the bylaws --MR
 GARRE: -- that they have pointed to in their brief --JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes
 MR
 GARRE: -- Justice Scalia, either, number one, explicitly say that the organization will 
comply with the rules and regulations of the school or 
say that they will admit all students
 That includes all the bylaws
 Now, they have pointed to various things from the bylaws, and this evolved as they™ve tried to 
create material factual issues in this Court
 One of 
 the things they've pointed to is the bylaws saying, like 
the Outlaw bylaw, that says that students who are 
members of a group can be excelled if they -- expelled 
if they engage in disruptive or gross misconduct
 There is nothing inconsistent about that with the school's 
policy
 The school's interest is not in allowing students to disrupt the activities of students' 
groups --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they -- they quite -- quote the bylaws of the National Lawyers Guild, 
which says any member must ﬁagree with the objectives 
of the organization as set forth herein
ﬂ That's not all-comers
 That's a bylaw that restricts an organization according to its -- members can't join 
unless they sign on the dotted line that they believe in 
objectives of the organization
 MR
 GARRE: There™s a fundamental difference between a group that says people of a 
particular sexual orientation are not allowed to become 
members --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they don™t say that
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It has nothing to do with --JUSTICE SCALIA: They don't say that
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's got nothing to  
 do with sexual -- well, I don't know the National 
Lawyers Guild, but they say you have got to agree with 
the objectives of the organization
 MR
 GARRE: Justice Scalia, the district court made a -- may I? CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, start with mine
 MR
 GARRE: Okay
 My apologies
 (Laughter
) MR
 GARRE: Mr
 Chief Justice, as -- as Dean -- as director of student services testified, the 
fact that the bylaws may say we want students who are 
interested in our activities doesn't mean that the 
bylaws are excluding students who want to join
 And there™s a fundamental difference, again, between saying 
students that have these particular beliefs or status 
cannot become members of our group --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that your position is continually evolving wherever the First 
Amendment pressure comes
 You™ve got a written nondiscrimination policy
 And then you say, well, yes, but we use an all-comers policy
 You™ve got an all-comers policy, and then groups don't actually follow 
the all-comers policy, and you have another answer to 
that
 It seems to me that we should go with -- why shouldn't we go with the written policy and the written  
 bylaws? MR
 GARRE: Well, with respect, Your Honor, I think it's my friend's position that is evolving
 You have joint stipulations before you as to what the policy 
is
 You have the decisions of both courts below describing that policy consistently with the joint 
stipulations, and you have a petition for certiorari 
that never challenges that the all-comers policy is at 
issue
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do we do with the selective application argument, which is what 
Justice Alito referred to and Justice Scalia, which is 
it is troubling that some of these bylaws do limit their 
groups? La Raza limited it to people of Hispanic descent, and the Lawyers Guild to people who adopt its 
-- its beliefs
 What are we going to do with this selective application argument? MR
 GARRE: This case wasn™t --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's in the case, isn't it? And if it is, what does it do to your policy? MR
 GARRE: Justice Sotomayor, this case wasn't litigated as a pretext case
 If you look at the briefs in this case, the first time that the word 
"pretext" is used is in the reply brief in this Court
 
It was litigated as a challenge, which is a serious  
 challenge, to the constitutionality of an all-comers 
policy in this particular forum
 JUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the two are connected, though, Mr
 Garre
 Frankly, one reason why I am inclined to think this is pretextual is that it is so 
weird to require the -- the campus Republican Club to 
admit Democrats, not just to membership, but to 
officership
 To require this Christian society to allow atheists not just to join, but to conduct Bible classes, 
right? That's crazy
 (Laughter
) MR
 GARRE: But --JUSTICE SCALIA: And is there any other university in the country that has this kind of a 
policy? MR
 GARRE: There absolutely is, Justice Scalia, and it's explained --JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that? MR
 GARRE: It's explained in the amicus brief for the American Council of 
Education, explained in the State Universities amicus 
brief
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there are very few universities
 But why doesn't this just all work out? If the Christian Legal Society has these beliefs, I am 
 not so sure why people that don't agree with them want 
to belong to them
 What -- doesn't this all just work out? MR
 GARRE: Justice Kennedy --JUSTICE KENNEDY: And doesn't it work out that the Democrats -- they don't want to go in the Republican 
club and run for officership anyway
 MR
 GARRE: Hastings --JUSTICE KENNEDY: So why -- what™s --what interest does this -- does the school have in this 
policing mechanism that it's imposing? MR
 GARRE: A few -- a number of things, Justice Kennedy
 The first is the line-drawing issue that has been made clear during the first part of the 
argument this morning
 If you're going -- they appear to take off the table race and what they say are other 
status considerations
 I'm not sure why that excludes sexual orientation
 But if you™re going to allow religious groups, or any group, to draw exceptions for some 
people, then you have to determine where to draw the 
line
 And I think a school can reasonably say: We don't want to get into this business at all; we want to 
allow all comers JUSTICE ALITO: But you now say --
 MR
 GARRE: -- for all school-subsidized groups
 JUSTICE ALITO: You now say in your brief that it is okay for a group to impose membership requirements that are neutral and not based on beliefs
 Isn't that right? MR
 GARRE: That doesn't go to status or belief
 If you™re talking about attendance requirements or competition --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, you™re talking about --MR
 GARRE: -- those are merits-based requirements
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- La Raza background
 As I understand it, the La Raza organization says you have 
to be of La Raza background to be a policy member of the organization
 MR
 GARRE: The La Raza bylaws -- first of all, they did explicitly say that groups could not exclude members on the basis of sexual orientation
 Now, they -- there was some confusion about how La Raza had interpreted their bylaws
 The school went back to La Raza and said: Are you excluding members? La Raza said: No, we™re not; we™re open to all
 And to eliminate any doubt, they amended their bylaws
 That's the one example they've come up in the -year history of this policy
 And what does it show? 
 If you want to look at --JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, wait, wait
 Twenty years? Do you have any evidence that this policy, the one we™re arguing about now, that is to say, the 
all-comers policy, existed before CLS brought this 
litigation? As I recall, the only evidence in the record is a letter from the dean describing this policy 
after the litigation began
 MR
 GARRE: Justice Scalia, it's based on the sworn deposition testimony on the former dean, who 
had been at the school since , the director of 
student services, who had been there at least since 
, as this is how they had implemented the 
nondiscrimination policy
 I don't think there™s any basis for this Court to overturn that sworn testimony
 JUSTICE BREYER: What we have is a rule, a stipulation
 And as I read it, to try to make sense out of it, it does seem to discriminate against 
organizations in respect to which intellectual purity 
would be important
 They™re going to have a harder time
 The ones that don't care that much will have an easier time
 Now, in trying to judge the constitutionality of that, I first have no idea which 
these organizations are
 We've got one of them, but  
 there may be a lot of others
 I don't know if the Democratic Club is or is not
 I don't know how big the tent they want
 I don't know whether the Turkish Society even exists
 I don't know how the chess club feels about players of tiddlywinks
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE BREYER: So I have an absolute void in this record, which in turn I think would be important 
to fill that void, because their justification --MR
 GARRE: Well --JUSTICE BREYER: -- is they don't want to get into this, it's too complicated, and we™re not 
doing that much harm to them because they can meet 
off-campus, and it's a big, disruptive influence, all of 
these things
 And then sneaking in here is this anti-gay bias issue, and -- and they want to say: That isn't much, because that isn't really the point here, and 
that's what we think, anyway
 It's just an example of something
 So with that great unclarity, asked to decide a constitutional issue where I feel I™d need more 
facts and I don't have them --MR
 GARRE: Well, you --JUSTICE BREYER: -- the more justification to 
 know what it really is, which I don't have, what should 
I do? MR
 GARRE: If the Court believes that, respectfully, we think it should dismiss the writ as 
improvidently granted
 This case was litigated based on stipulations to avoid precisely these factual issues 
that we™re now talking about for the first time before 
this Court
 Now, I think it is common ground that --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- Mr
 Garre, you did say that the evidence is the dean's deposition
 
There™s no prior evidence
 But there are schools, including law schools, that have this policy
 Is that not so? MR
 GARRE: That's true
 Georgetown Law School does
 Columbia Law School
 Look, there™s an amicus brief filed by  educational organizations 
representing thousands of colleges and universities 
across the country, including the Association of Jesuit 
Colleges and Universities, saying that this is a 
not-uncommon and a reasonable policy
 We™re not saying it's the only approach that colleges can take in 
balancing the competing interests here
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let™s explore --MR
 GARRE: We™re saying it™s a  
 constitutional --JUSTICE ALITO: Let's explore the implications of this policy
 Suppose at a particular campus there is a great deal of anti-Muslim animus
 
And there™s a small Muslim group; it has  students
 
If the group is required to accept anybody who applies 
for membership, and  students who hate Muslims show up 
and they want to take over that group, you say the First 
Amendment allows that? MR
 GARRE: Justice Alito, that™s the claim, obviously, that the other side is making
 And, with respect, this example has never happened at 
Hastings in  years
 It has really never happened in the history of American education
 If you look at cases like the voter I
D
 case, the partial-birth abortion 
case --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you have a law that says every newspaper that™s published in the 
United States must be reviewed every day by the 
government's censor board, and the fact that the 
government's censor board decides not to do it, then 
that law is okay? MR
 GARRE: I think this Court would ordinarily take into account the likelihood that 
something would happen, and if you're dealing where the  
 only experience --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A newspaper sues saying that law is constitutional, and we™ll say it's all right; it has never been applied? MR
 GARRE: Of course this Court is going to examine the chill, but so -- just like in the voter I
D
 case, 
where you had had people saying this was going to and, 
on secondhand accounts, did exclude people from getting to the -- ballot access
 This Court said, look, that might happen, but it's not a basis to invalidate this law across the board
 Come back with an as-applied challenge
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was because they might adopt a different policy
 We™re not dealing with a future different policy in this case
 MR
 GARRE: And there's -- as to the takeover hypothetical, there is no evidence that it has 
happened
 Groups can take measures to prevent it
 They can require attendance requirements before people become members
 They can instruct into their bylaws --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not going to help if you have the  anti-Muslim students who want to take over the group
 MR
 GARRE: People have to be -- attend a certain number of meetings before they can join
 They can have -- 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay
 They take over the group and the first thing they do is say we™re 
abolishing the attendance policy
 (Laughter
) MR
 GARRE: They can have in their -- they can -- sure
 I mean, we can entertain the hypotheticals
 But they can have in their bylaws a provision just like the Constitution of the United 
States, that amendments can only be made by a 
super-majority --JUSTICE ALITO: Well, CLS obviously thinks this is a real threat
 Now, what do you propose that they do? Suppose that you win this case, and then when the case -- and then when this all-applicants policy is 
administered, then precisely what they fear begins to 
take place
 Do they have any recourse? MR
 GARRE: I think if that started to take place, the college would reconsider its policy
 It could bring a First Amendment challenge saying that --JUSTICE ALITO: No, do they have any --MR
 GARRE: -- that would --JUSTICE ALITO: Do they have any recourse? MR
 GARRE: I think at that point --JUSTICE ALITO: If they have  members, and  who are completely hostile to the organization 
 sign up? MR
 GARRE: I think obviously the members would rejoin and form another group, Your Honor
 I mean, we™re not dealing with this in a factual vacuum
 
CLS's predecessor existed at the schools for  years 
and in --JUSTICE ALITO: I understand the answer to that question
 So, if -- if hostile members take over CLS, the former members of CLS can form CLS II? (Laughter
) MR
 GARRE: If that happened Your Honor
 I mean, this has never happened ever in -- in the history 
of --JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's also the --MR
 GARRE: -- education
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the university's across-the-board rules for all student conduct against 
disruption, against incivility
 The list would certainly carry over
 MR
 GARRE: Absolutely
 And CLS, like any group, can have a rule that disruptive members should be 
expelled
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I™m sorry
 I don™t understand your --JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's also never happened 
 from, what I can tell, that someone who disagrees with 
this group has applied for membership
 MR
 GARRE: Well, Your Honor, the record does show that --JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that's -- that's what so puzzling about the -- the case
 MR
 GARRE: The record does show, Your Honor, that there was a gay student who was a member of 
the group
 And that's -- let me give you that --JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the predecessor group
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The predecessor group --MR
 GARRE: That was the predecessor group
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and obviously uncomfortable with their position, so he or she left
 MR
 GARRE: Well, actually --JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the way it works
 MR
 GARRE: -- what the record shows is that she participated in discussions that the officer of the 
group said it was a joy to have her and that both sides 
learned
 I think CLS's position depends on the dark notion that students would not have any interest in 
joining a group with different viewpoints on certain 
issues except to disrupt that group
 And I think that  
 greatly undersells the intellectual curiosity of 
students
 It greatly undersells the fact that groups have many different interests and perspectives
 The church has a stance in homosexuality, but it has stances on many other issues, too
 And if a student -- even if he or she disagrees with the stance on 
homosexuality, they may agree with many other aspects of 
the groups, and they may want to join in the fellowship of 
that group, they want to take advantage of intangible 
benefits like not --JUSTICE SCALIA: Teach Bible classes? Right? MR
 GARRE: Your Honor --JUSTICE SCALIA: You have to let them teach Bible classes, too, right? MR
 GARRE: In fact, the record in the --case shows that only officers teach Bible classes, 
and groups are perfectly free to structure their 
organization like that
 They can have requirements that people attend certain meetings before they do that
 
CLS isn't forced to have anyone lead Bible classes
 JUSTICE ALITO: If an orthodox --MR
 GARRE: CLS --JUSTICE ALITO: If an orthodox Jewish group or a Muslim group applied for recognition and the group 
 said part of our beliefs is -- one of our beliefs is that 
men and women should sit separately at religious services, 
would Hastings deny registration to that group? MR
 GARRE: If it was excluding students from that group on the basis of their beliefs or their 
status, then, yes, it would
 Hastings isn't in the business of second-guessing the -- the beliefs of -- of individual 
groups, and the whole point of the policy really is to 
stay out of this, to just have a blanket rule that™s 
equally neutral
 JUSTICE ALITO: We have -- we have two amicus briefs from orthodox Jewish groups and a brief from a 
Muslim group
 So, your answer is that they could not be recognized under Hastings' policy because of their 
religious beliefs regarding the way religious services 
should be conducted? MR
 GARRE: Your Honor, I think even my friend recognizes that a group could not exclude an 
individual on the basis of their gender or their 
beliefs -- on the basis of their gender or race
 
And remember the Bob Jones case, this Court --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's because gender or race is fundamentally different from religious 
brief
 Gender and race is a status
 Religious belief -- 
 it has to be based on the fundamental notion that we are 
not open to everybody
 We have beliefs, you have to subscribe to them
 And we™ve always regarded that as a good thing
 That type of exclusion is supported in --in the Constitution
 The other types of exclusion are not
 MR
 GARRE: But not at all costs, Mr
 Chief Justice
 In the Bob Jones case, the claim was from a -- a small private religious school that has a 
sincere religious belief that people who believed in 
interracial dating should not become members of their 
school
 And this Court, nevertheless, held that that belief, sincere as it was, did not trump a statute that 
denied education -- denied Federal financial assistance 
on a viewpoint-neutral basis to schools that 
discriminated on the basis of religion
 Here we have a -- a group that wants to exclude members on the basis of sexual orientation
 We can -- CLS has tried to change that part --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You phrase it that way
 It's a group that wants to exclude -- a religious group, a religious-oriented group, that wants to exclude 
people who do not subscribe to their religious beliefs
 MR
 GARRE: They -- there is a binding judicial admission
 And, again, this gets back to the  
 Bob Jones example
 I think --JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- yes, let's get back to this homosexual orientation
 You say that that's established in the case
 MR
 GARRE: Look at page -- J
A
 page , which is where the district court said that CLS made 
a binding judicial admission that they wanted to 
discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation
 Keep in mind that this case began because CLS came back to 
the law school and said we™re happy to say we won't 
discriminate on some grounds, but we™re not going to 
say we won't exclude students on the basis of sexual 
orientation
 JUSTICE BREYER: What™s supposed to happen? I don't know the answer to this
 Hastings, let's say, or Berkeley has four or five or six different religious 
chapels for services on Sunday or Saturday, and they say 
we™re open to all branches of religion, orthodox Jews, 
conservative, and reformed
 And then the orthodox say we want men and women to sit separately
 Now, can Hastings say or Berkeley, no, we™ll let the reform come, we™ll let the conservatives come, 
but not the -- not the orthodox Jews
 They can't have their service
 Would -- would that be constitutional? 
 MR
 GARRE: Your Honor, I think it would be a much different case
 It --JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but what is your opinion? MR
 GARRE: I -- I think if the school is regulating outside of the purposes of a limited forum, 
public forum for recognized groups, then I doubt it 
could go in --JUSTICE BREYER: So if, in fact, the --the --MR
 GARRE: -- and tell the groups --JUSTICE BREYER: -- they have clubs and they™re not services, and what they do is they discuss -- they 
discuss the -- the nature of the service, and there can 
they have separate discussions --MR
 GARRE: Where -- where --JUSTICE BREYER: -- men from -- men and women? MR
 GARRE: Where the rule operates on a viewpoint-neutral basis
 Here what the -- the school is doing is it is publicly subsidizing --JUSTICE BREYER: I guess your answer to that is the orthodox Jews cannot
 They cannot have separate women's groups in their organization, which is 
an after religious school organization
 MR
 GARRE: They can exist separately
 At 
 the school we have are numerous --JUSTICE BREYER: Outside of the university, et cetera
 MR
 GARRE: In fact, Your Honor, it's not --it™s not --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's their problem here
 MR
 GARRE: -- unusual for schools to have all male or all women clubs
 They are not recognized parts of the community
 These -- these are activities that are subsidized by the students themselves through the mandatory student activities fees
 JUSTICE BREYER: And their reason to put in a sentence as to why they don't want these orthodox Jews to meet separately on the campus -- men in one group, women in another -- and discuss the religious service 
-- they want none like that, and their reason for wanting none like that is? MR
 GARRE: Well, I think that's a much different example than this case --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm trying to make it as close as possible
 MR
 GARRE: Well, I -- I may have misunderstood the hypothetical
 I mean, I think it's a much different --JUSTICE BREYER: They have a small orthodox  
 club
 MR
 GARRE: The reason why the school has a policy that all groups that it subsidizes must admit 
all-comers is that, number one, it ensures that all 
students enjoy equal access to all school-subsidized and 
school-recognized activities
 Number two, it avoids the line-drawing problems that we™ve discussed early this morning and I 
think are necessarily going to arise and also create 
strife in small educational communities
 Number three, it allows --JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask about number , the -- the so-called line-drawing problem? Aren't you just letting yourself into even more line-drawing 
problems? MR
 GARRE: Not with the all-comers rule
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the other -- it™s whether you were discriminating on the basis of one of 
the forbidden bases
 But now you™re saying you can't discriminate on any basis, which means there™re going 
to be even more lines to have to draw
 Why does it solve your problem? MR
 GARRE: I don't think it -- that happens at all, Justice Scalia
 I think when you™ve the policy that all students have to become members,  
 regardless of their status or belief, that gets the 
school out of the business of determining whether, 
number one, people are discriminating on the basis of an 
essential belief, which is, is the way that Petitioner 
describes his -- their rule
 JUSTICE ALITO: As I understood the position, your latest position in your brief, you 
really don't say you have an all-comers policy
 There are certain criteria that can be applied, like interest, 
knowledge; is that correct? MR
 GARRE: Competitive-based, merit-based requirements are not excluded
 It -- they™re not --JUSTICE ALITO: Could a -- well, could a group, consistent with your revised all-comers policy, 
require that members who want -- anyone who wants to 
become a member show a particular level of knowledge 
about the subject of the group? MR
 GARRE: Yes
 And I think --JUSTICE ALITO: So if the CLS required anybody who wanted to become a member to pass a test on 
the Bible, that would be okay? MR
 GARRE: If it were truly an objective knowledge test, it would be okay
 It would be no different than the law review
 These are merits-based  
 determinations
 There™s a fundamental difference between excluding people on the basis of merit and 
excluding people on the basis of status or belief that 
has no connection to merit
 That -- that, I think, is a long-standing understanding of discrimination
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that --that -- that's pretty tough
 That has no connection to merit
 I assume there are groups that think subscribing to their beliefs is evidence of merit, particularly 
religious groups
 So, how can you have a -- a test that allows distinctions based on merit but not -- not 
beliefs? MR
 GARRE: I think it goes to the nature of whether it's discrimination under the school's policy, 
and I think status or belief
 People understand -- that's why we are talking about things like race or gender or 
sexual orientation, disability, military status, any 
number of these things
 And I think the school's policy avoids having to draw lines as to whether or not a group 
has a sufficient enough belief that military members 
should become a member of the Amnesty International club 
because they disagree with the war, that disabled 
members should be -- disabled students should be a 
member of a particular group
 And the school's policy avoids these line-drawing --
 JUSTICE ALITO: If the school adopt an all-comers policy --JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, Mr
 Garre? JUSTICE ALITO: -- for the purpose --JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask one question? I'd like you to answer, and I™d like your opponent, too: 
Do you think that, in order to decide this case, we have 
to pass on the constitutionality of an all-comers policy? MR
 GARRE: Yes, that's the policy before this Court
 JUSTICE STEVENS: That we must do that to decide the case? And I want to ask your opponent the same question
 MR
 GARRE: I believe you have to do that, because that is the policy --JUSTICE STEVENS: So they're all --MR
 GARRE: -- before this Court
 JUSTICE STEVENS: There may be a lot of other things we can decide, but in all events, we must 
decide that much? MR
 GARRE: Absolutely
 Absolutely
 If I could just discuss briefly the --JUSTICE ALITO: Well, could I just ask one quick question relating to that? 
 If -- if an all-comers policy is adopted for the purpose of discriminating on the basis of viewpoint, 
does it violate the First Amendment? MR
 GARRE: If it's pretextual in the Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye sense, yes
 No -- no school can purposely discriminate at a group, no matter what policy 
it adopts
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what if we think that the policy has not been evenhandedly applied? Can't we decide the case on that basis, and then we could just 
assume arguendo Justice -- the answer to Justice 
Stevens' question
 MR
 GARRE: I don't think so, Justice --Justice Kennedy, because that --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is -- was there any proof in this record? I mean, there™s a stipulation for summary judgment
 Was there any proof showing that it wasn't evenly applied? MR
 GARRE: No
 And I get back to the petition for certiorari
 On page  of the petition, the petition --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me just say, suppose it were shown that it were not applied evenhandedly, you™d 
have no problem with our saying that it™s then 
unconstitutional
 
 MR
 GARRE: It -- yes
 We don't think that that's the case here
 But if a policy is applied evenhandedly -- unevenhandedly, in a viewpoint-neutral way and it burdens religious groups, then there™s 
common ground that that policy violates the Constitution
 Of course, we think the policy here is --JUSTICE ALITO: If this were an employment case, and when an employee is denied promotion the 
employee said it's for reason A, and then after litigation begins the employer says, well, no, it really 
wasn't for reason A, it was for reason B because of a policy that we™ve long had, but there™s never --there™s no written documentation of this new policy; 
and then at a later point in the litigation the employer says, well, it wasn't really either for reason A or reason B; it was for reason C -- do you think that summary 
judgment could be granted in favor of the employer on the issue of pretext? MR
 GARRE: I think that that would create a factual issue and that that issue might well be tried, 
Justice Alito
 And the one thing that is important to keep in mind is that this is a request for injunctive relief and not 
damages
 So the only policy that matters -- and Wilkinson v
 Austin makes this clear -- is the current policy; all 
 parties agree that the current policy is the all-comers 
policy
 That's the policy supported by the record in this case
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sorry
 All parties do not agree that the policy is the all-comers 
policy
 Your friend argued repeatedly that the policy was the written nondiscrimination policy
 MR
 GARRE: I understood my friend's opening brief to acknowledge at the least that that's the policy 
the school has said it has today
 It is the school's policy
 It™s supported by substantial history and sworn deposition testimony
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Garre, the -- the so-called written policy, that has a -- that list has a 
correspondence to the State's law, doesn't it? MR
 GARRE: It does
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The categories that are listed there are the categories that under California 
law are proscribed bases for discrimination? MR
 GARRE: It does
 And that is an additional basis for the school's policy
 Look at California Education Code 
 It explicitly prohibits discrimination in -- in programs and 
educational activities by public schools like Hastings
 
Hastings has an obligation under State law to prohibit 
 discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation
 The reason why we™re here today is because CLS insisted 
on the right to discriminate, to exclude students on the 
basis of their sexual orientation
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, section  applies to programs conducted by a post-secondary educational 
institution, and your position is that if -- if a 
religious group complies with your policies and then it 
conducts religious services, those religious services 
are conducted by Hastings? MR
 GARRE: Our position is that the registered student organization program is a program 
of the university; it™s subsidized by the university; 
it™s recognized by the university; and that all students 
should be able to enjoy access to that program
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In your response to Justice Ginsburg concerning California law, is it your 
position that California law requires religious groups 
to admit people who do not believe in their religious 
beliefs and in fact to conduct services of that group? MR
 GARRE: Your Honor, our position is that the provision that we've cited to, , does not carve 
out an exemption in this program for a religious student 
organization
 On its face --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the answer to my  
 question is "yes"? MR
 GARRE: Yes
 On its face, it excludes --it has an exemption for religious schools; it does not 
include an exemption for religious organizations within 
the context of this program
 And we think that the program is reasonable
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr
 Garre
 MR
 GARRE: Thank you very much
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr
 McConnell, you have  minutes remaining
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W
 McCONNELL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR
 McCONNELL: Well, thank you, Mr
 Chief Justice
 First, in answer to Justice Stevens' question, we do believe that the Court needs to 
reach the constitutionality of the all-comers policy as 
applied to CLS in this case
 We brought only an as-applied challenge
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Put -- put to a side a moment -- forget the as-applied
 Just take a -- a pure all-comers policy
 Must we decide the constitutionality of that? MR
 McCONNELL: Not facially, but as applied 
 to CLS, yes
 Several other points, I know --JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you talk about -- I had understood from your brief that CLS did not have a -- a 
policy of excluding people with homosexual disposition, 
but that it was only homosexual conduct
 MR
 McCONNELL: That's correct as stipulated to, undisputed
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- but your complaint said otherwise
 Your -- your --MR
 McCONNELL: That's -- that's because we -- the complaint is accepting the -- Hastings' 
definition of sexual orientation
 We were told that our conduct rule, our nonmarital conduct rule, violated their 
sexual orientation provision, and therefore we sought 
relief from their sexual orientation provision
 It was nothing more than that
 There -- it is -- it is stipulated in Joint Stipulation , I believe it is, that -- that CLS's rule 
is based on conduct --JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay
 MR
 McCONNELL: -- not orientation
 Several other points: My friend twice in his presentation stated that the all-comers policy is 
simply their way of implementing the nondiscrimination 
policy
 But if so, it is so absurdly overbroad as to be 
 unconstitutional
 There is no reason to stop the environmentalist club from leading -- from requiring its 
leaders to share environmentalist views --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 McConnell --MR
 McCONNELL: -- in order to --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 McConnell, you don't challenge that there are universities, including four 
law schools, that have an all-comers policy? MR
 McCONNELL: So far as we™ve been able to tell, there is no public university law school in the 
country that has such a policy
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are private universities
 MR
 McCONNELL: There are some private universities that, according to the AALS, have such a 
policy
 We know nothing about them
 They are not in the record, and, frankly, I™d be a little bit 
surprised, because the policy is so absurd
 Think of how it would apply to the law school itself, and this policy does apply to the law 
school itself
 Does Hastings really mean to say it is committing itself to an all-comers policy when it hires 
faculty or admits students? Do they not care about the belief of its dean of admissions, about beliefs of --
about, say, affirmative action? The very idea of it is  
 preposterous
 JUSTICE BREYER: It's not totally, if -- but it's imaginary, it's fantastical
 The -- you could imagine a school in the 's that said that we think the way to 
advance learning is everyone gets together in a nice 
discussion group and hugs each other and talks, all 
right? (Laughter
) 
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's a possible educational theory
 MR
 McCONNELL: It's possible, but --JUSTICE BREYER: They say that we are going to apply that to everybody because that's how we do it
 And --MR
 McCONNELL: Yes, but Hastings has --JUSTICE BREYER: -- if there are any ideological organizations that suffer --MR
 McCONNELL: But Hastings has --JUSTICE BREYER: -- so be it, but it's fantastical, and therefore --MR
 McCONNELL: Hastings has a perfectly conventional RSO program just like the ones in Healy, 
and Widmar and Rosenberger
 They just have a policy that is destructive of that --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, my --MR
 McCONNELL: -- of that program
  
 board's power? MR
 RICHIE: Clearly
 JUSTICE BREYER: Clearly
 Okay
 So what is the difference between the situation I just described 
and this situation where the Board simply delegated its 
power to three people and one of them dies? What's the difference? I can't find any difference in the language
 So what is the difference? MR
 RICHIE: Justice Breyer, the difference is that in this statute there is a clear statement that 
at all times the board must have a three-member quorum
 
In your hypothetical there were still four members
 JUSTICE BREYER: Correct
 MR
 RICHIE: The board was still in place
 JUSTICE BREYER: Except that two members shall constitute a quorum of any group designated 
pursuant to the first sentence, which says "The board is 
authorized to delegate to any group of three all of the 
powers which it may itself exercise
 " So, what's the 
difference? MR
 RICHIE: Well, the difference is that once the -- the difference between the hypothetical and 
the situation we are in is that there were four members, 
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I know that, but I'm  
 asking why does that make a difference? MR
 RICHIE: It makes a difference because the statute requires that at all times the board shall 
have a quorum of three members, a minimum quorum of 
three members
 JUSTICE BREYER: Except
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't that tied to a quorum for the board as a whole to act? Once it's delegated a responsibility to a three-member board, it's 
already said, unless it takes another vote, that it's 
going to let those three people decide
 It has -- I understand the word "delegated" to mean it's given over 
its power to a subgroup
 If it wants to take it back, it needs a quorum to do that
 That's what I understand
 MR
 RICHIE: Well, I think the problem is, Justice Sotomayor, that the delegation to a group of 
three is indeed a valid delegation
 We don't contest that
 But what we have here is a phantom group
 And what the -- what the board said, because member 
Kirsanow's term expired in December, about  days after 
the delegation
 And if you look at the minutes of the board when they are delegating to the group, it says in 
the minutes that they "are continuing to be a two-member 
quorum of a three-member group," as if member Kirsanow 
is a phantom 
 It's a fiction
 The group ceases to  
 exist and the board -- it's not just that the board 
falls below three and the board ceases to exist with all 
delegated powers to this group
 The group ceases to exist
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that brings you back to Justice Breyer's hypothetical
 There's five members on the board
 Clearly they can delegate under the statute
 Now there are only four members
 Something happens to the fifth
 Under your theory, the entity that originally delegated no longer exists and therefore 
the group, the entity that received the delegation of 
powers, must cease, must cease to act
 MR
 RICHIE: JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the quorum of three that authorized two to act disappears and that means the 
principal is no longer there, so the agent can't 
exercise the authority, why isn't it the same when five 
become four? MR
 RICHIE: Well, we believe that the 
terrible sentence
 It's not the same because the statute contemplates vacancies on the board and multiple 
vacancies, so long as they don't go below three
 The statute -- the vacancy clause in the statute doesn't 
apply to a group at all
 So the delegating group in the  
 hypothetical clearly is still in place as the board 
because it's the board that delegated
 And the board still exists
 JUSTICE ALITO: As far as the interests of your client are concerned, is there any functional 
difference between what happened here and what could 
happen very routinely even if the board had five 
members, namely that after the case was assigned to a 
three-member panel one of the three members of the panel 
became unable to sit on that case, but the remaining two 
members were able to reach agreement so the case could 
be decided? MR
 RICHIE: Justice Alito, the difference is that here there was never a way to reconstitute this 
board -- I'm sorry, the group -- as three members
 When you have five or you have four members of the board and 
a member of a three-member group is unable to perform 
JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't there another difference? Is it not the case that the decisions of these panels can be appealed to the full board? Are they automatically final? Can the board not revise the decision of one of its panels? MR
 RICHIE: Well, I believe that the board could revise the decision of one of its panels
  
 MR
 RICHIE: The adjudication is final
 JUSTICE SCALIA: The adjudication is final
 MR
 RICHIE: Of the three-member group
 JUSTICE SCALIA: There is no appeal to the full board? MR
 RICHIE: That is correct
 JUSTICE BREYER: Then what is the reason --I now see
 Your answer to my question is that the JUSTICE SCALIA: You've got to tell me more than you believe it
 What is the case?vacancy clause applies to the full board but not to the group
 MR
 RICHIE: That's correct, Justice Breyer
 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay
 Now, got that answer
 And now I see how you could read the statute that way
 So, now I would like -- and that would be in your favor
 MR
 RICHIE: That's true
 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and, therefore, I would like to know, since you could also read it the 
other way, why should it be read your way? I mean, I can think of a lot of reasons why not
 One is something that Justice Scalia was raising: It may work havoc as to what remains effective, what doesn't, what about the 
board staff decisions, which are, which aren't
 I can 
 see a lot of reasons for not doing it
 But what are your best reasons for reading that vacancy clause the way you want me to read it? MR
 RICHIE: Justice Breyer, we -- we believe that it is important to have a promote -- to 
have a robust debate and an expression of -- a potential 
for expression of dissent
 And what you have here is you have two members in a group and -- who have publicly 
announced that on more than one occasion over the last  
years plus  months when this board has sat with only  
members, that they have sometimes compromised their 
opinions in the interest of the institutional purposes, 
basically to keep the doors open
 And so you don't have a full and robust debate
 You don't have the potential for an expression of a dissenting view, and that's the -- that's the 
distinction that we see
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the problem is that that exists whether we read your rule or not in the way 
you want
 You have -- you've conceded that a three-member board could lose a member, a three-member 
group could lose a member and its acts still be binding, 
as long as you say there is -- there is three members on 
the full board
 But this lack of opportunity for dissent exists any time there is a vacancy
 You just  
 don't like the system
 MR
 RICHIE: Justice Sotomayor, if we consented that when there was an absence, a member who 
dies, retires, is incapacitated, that the two members of 
a properly constituted three -- three-member group could 
still function, I certainly did not mean to say that
 
We do not consent to that or agree with that 
proposition
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry
 You are now saying that the group always has to be three members? MR
 RICHIE: Yes
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That somebody can't die, leave, recuse themselves from that group without 
invalidating the actions of that subgroup
 Where in the statute do you read that limitation when it says a 
quorum of two is okay to act? MR
 RICHIE: The definition of a quorum, Justice Sotomayor, is the minimum number of persons of a 
body necessary to transact business
 The body here is defined as three or more people
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I am talking about the group
 MR
 RICHIE: I am, too
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the group is not defined as three or more people
 It's defined as three
  
 The board is defined as three or more
 The group is defined as three
 So I'm -- I'm a little confused
 MR
 RICHIE: In the statute, the group is defined as -- the board is authorized, and I'm reading 
from (b), Appendix a to our brief: "The board is authorized to delegate to any group of three or more 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I see
 MR
 RICHIE: -- "any or all" -- that is where we find it necessary that the group must contain 
at least three members
 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's a totally different argument from the one that relies upon the 
size of the board, right? MR
 RICHIE: It is, and we think it's an additional argument
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even if the board were still properly constituted and had a full five members, 
if one of the three members to a -- a board should die, 
it would no longer be a three-member board and could no 
longer be, as your argument goes, the recipient of the 
delegation, right? MR
 RICHIE: That's correct, Justice Scalia
 But what's happened routinely for -- for  years since 
 when Taft-Hartley was passed, is that what the  
 board did was it reconstituted the panels any time a 
member died or retired
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There have been situations before where the board dwindled to two 
members
 Is this the first time that the board has continued to adjudicate the cases that they can, or when 
there were prior periods with only two did the board 
continue to adjudicate? MR
 RICHIE: This is the first time, yes
 For over -- from  through  -- up to , any time 
the board fell to two members -- as far as we know, any 
time the board fell to two members, the board 
reconstituted -- I'm sorry
 Any time a group fell to two members, the board reconstituted the group to a 
three-member group
 JUSTICE ALITO: There is a well-established practice on the court of appeals that when a three-judge 
panel for some reason loses one of the members due to a 
death or resignation or recusal, the panel can continue 
to decide the case if the remaining two judges can 
agree
 And -- and do you see -- do you think the -- the situation is different with the NLRB for some reason? 
Or do you think that that -- that those decisions on the 
courts of appeals are unlawful as well? MR
 RICHIE: Well, Justice Alito, I think  
 it's a different statute
 But we also -- I also think the court of appeals, which is the delegating body that 
forms the -- the three-member courts, still is in 
existence
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you are shifting arguments
 You can't keep jumping back and forth between the two arguments
 The one is that the appointing body has to still be fully constituted, or at 
least have a quorum, and the other one, which I thought 
Justice Alito was addressing, is the quite separate 
argument that the recipient of the delegation has to be 
three
 And when it falls below three it's only two
 And I don't know that you have a response to -- to -- to his point, with respect to the latter 
argument, except -- except that it's a different 
statute
 MR
 RICHIE: Well, Justice Scalia, it's a different statute but it's also a very temporary and 
limited circumstance
 You have a panel that was formed to hear a case
 Here you have got a delegation of all the authority, the board has -- the group has become the 
board, and we effectively have a two-member National 
Labor Relations Board
 JUSTICE BREYER: So I would have thought, but this is only me -- other people don't necessarily go  
 in for this kind of argument
 the -- the arguments in your favor, the one that sort of 
resonated a bit with me was that this is a very 
Republican Congress in  that passed Taft-Hartley, 
and one of the things they were really aiming at was to 
move the board from three to five
 And this is a way so that that just doesn't happen
 But I assume from the briefs filed that there is no supporting legislative history for that, 
what I've just said, so I better wipe it out of my mind
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE SCALIA: If there is no legislative history, it could be true
 (Laughter
) MR
 RICHIE: Justice Breyer, the legislative history I think is -- there is no legislative history on 
what happens when the board falls below two members
 
But it is clear that from  to , the board was 
made up of three members, and the statute clearly said 
under the Wagner Act two members could be a quorum of a 
three-member board
 In  when Taft-Hartley was passed, Congress intentionally increased the quorum and 
increased the size of the board
 If it had intended to have only two members serve at any time as a two-member  
 board, they would not -- that would be a strange way to 
do it, in a statute that not only increases the size of 
the board, but changes the minimum quorum requirement 
from two to three
 JUSTICE ALITO: I was surprised by your answer to -- I was surprised by your answer to one of 
the earlier questions, because one of your amici says 
that any member of the board, regardless of whether he 
or she sits on the panel hearing a case, may request 
that the case be heard by all five board members
 Is that -- is that not correct? MR
 RICHIE: That is correct, but that's to hear it as opposed to overturn it once the decision is 
made
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Heard an initial -- an initial decision
 But just -- the review of the panel is in the court of appeals, right? MR
 RICHIE: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you could have initially a panel of five, but that would not be 
reviewing the panel of three? MR
 RICHIE: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg
 The -- the -- the five-member board would not review the three-member group's decision
 But  
 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the use of having a five-member board, then? I really don't understand MR
 RICHIE: JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if you have a -- you are changing, oh, we had a three-member board, that's no 
good, we thought that's unfair
 We are going to make to five
 But then we allow the five to convert themselves to three for finally deciding all the cases
 what has been accomplished? MR
 RICHIE: JUSTICE SCALIA: Nothing
 MR
 RICHIE: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia
 Multiple members of three
 And so before you had a -- a -- without a delegation, you had a group 
of three members
 They could -- that group could JUSTICE ALITO: The amicus says that the members of the board not serving on a panel are given 
the opportunity to review draft decisions, thus no case 
will issue unless it reflects the majority opinion of 
the full board
 MR
 RICHIE: JUSTICE ALITO: So that can be, in effect,  
 the opportunity for full board review before a draft 
decision is issued in final form; is that the way it 
works? MR
 RICHIE: Yes, Justice Alito, it does
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: MR
 RICHIE: CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Only if a majority of the board wants to do that, right? MR
 RICHIE: No, Mr
 Chief Justice
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One member of the full board can overturn a group delegation, in other 
words, and hear the initial decision? MR
 RICHIE: No, Mr
 Chief Justice
 They can agree to -- to review the decision and they can 
agree before the decision is made to join the panel, 
basically is what they do
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if one board member wants to do that and four don't? What happens? MR
 RICHIE: One member wants to join the panel? CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One member wants to review the group's decision
 MR
 RICHIE: That member would review the group's decision
 He wouldn't be able -- he or she wouldn't be able to overturn the group's decision
  
 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- I am really confused now
 Is it or is it not the case that the full board has the power to review a decision of one of these 
panels? Before you said no; before you said it's final
 MR
 RICHIE: The decision is final once it is rendered
 They can review the decision in draft form JUSTICE SCALIA: But that is -- that is my question, whether they -- they can review it before it 
is rendered, is that what you are saying? MR
 RICHIE: They can do that or they can ask to be included on the -- on the panel
 JUSTICE SCALIA: They can review it before it is rendered
 Okay
 MR
 RICHIE: But they can't overturn it
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is this different from the practice that some courts of appeals follow of 
circulating a panel decision to the full court some days 
before it's issued to the public? That doesn't put the non-panel members on the panel
 Is this practice that you are describing the same or is it different? MR
 RICHIE: I believe it's the same, Justice Ginsburg, that it's exactly the same
 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's quite different from the court of appeals sitting en banc
 
The practice of circulating the opinion does not put all 
of the members of the court on the panel
 MR
 RICHIE: That is correct, Justice Ginsburg
 JUSTICE ALITO: But it provides an opportunity for them to vote to hear the case en banc 
before it's ever issued
 MR
 RICHIE: That's correct, Justice Alito
 It does
 And it -- and therefore you have what we don't have here, is an opportunity for a robust debate
 If there are no other questions I would like to reserve the remainder of my time
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 Mr
 Katyal
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K
 KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MR
 KATYAL: Thank you, Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We agree that the plain text controls this case and there are three features to that text
 First, section (b) permits delegation of any or all of the board's power to three or more 
members
 Second, that section sets out a general quorum 
 rule of three members
 And third, as Justices Alito --Justices Alito, Kennedy and Ginsburg have pointed out, 
there is the phrase "except that" in the rule, a special 
quorum provision that sets up panel quorums at two 
members
 And in this case, faced with a vacancy crisis, the board validly delegated its powers in 
December  to a three-member panel, and Petitioners 
have never contested otherwise
 Rather, they argue that JUSTICE SCALIA: Just before the third member no longer became -- no longer was a member of the 
board
 MR
 KATYAL: That's true
 JUSTICE SCALIA: So knowing when it gave it to this three member panel that it would shortly become 
a two-member panel, and that thereby the board would be 
able to act with only two members instead of with three, 
which is what the quorum requirement for the board is
 I must say that seems to be a very strange procedure when you have a statute that says the board 
has to -- has to have three for a quorum
 When the board sees, oh, God, we are about to lose our third 
member, let's set up a three-member panel with this guy 
who's about to go off
 It will immediately become a  
 two-member panel and then we can act with only two 
members
 That's wonderful
 It doesn't seem to you like an evasion of the whole purpose of the -- of the quorum requirement? MR
 KATYAL: I don't think so
 I think it's precisely what was -- what the text allows, because it's 
not, Justice Scalia, simply a three-member quorum 
requirement
 It's a three-member quorum requirement, "except that
" JUSTICE STEVENS: Except -- may I just interrupt a bit, just on the "except" clause at the very 
bottom
 When you are talking about individual cases it's easy
 Sure, one member dies; the other two can finish
 But you are talking about long-run governance of the board
 The two members -- two members shall constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to 
the first sentence
 Now,  years later, after -- what is the group designated pursuant to the first sentence at the 
time of the decision  years later? MR
 KATYAL: It is the same group of people JUSTICE STEVENS: But there is no such group exists at the time that that power is being exercised
 MR
 KATYAL: Well, Justice Stevens, the  
 language is written in the past tense
 the language in this is found in the government's brief 
at a
 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, it's not the past tense
 "Two members shall constitute a quorum
" MR
 KATYAL: "Of any group designated pursuant to" the first sentence
 JUSTICE STEVENS: But there is no group around at the time they're -- that this case is being 
decided, that was designated before
 MR
 KATYAL: That group was designated on JUSTICE STEVENS: But your -- your inquiry is focusing on what happens  years later
 MR
 KATYAL: And -- and with respect to  years later, I submit to you that that penultimate 
sentence in (b) is met
 That is a designated group pursuant to the first sentence
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't know how you could write the sentence without the "ed" unless you 
want to say -- to make your point, if the statute had 
been written the other way, to any group continuously 
being designated
 MR
 KATYAL: Sure, I think you could say something like constitute a -- that two members shall  
 constitute a quorum of any group that continues to meet 
the requirements of the first sentence thereof, or 
something like that
 JUSTICE BREYER: To read -- you can read the language the way you want, that -- because of the 
vacancy clause
 You see, there is a sentence there that says "A vacancy shall not impair the right of the 
remaining members to exercise the power
" That implies in the absence of that clause, five to four, they 
couldn't
 Okay? Now, you say that clause applies to the remaining members, i
e
, to the three
 And now we don't have three
 and you have to have three
 there's not -- there are not the remaining members, you 
see
 MR
 KATYAL: Right
 So let me say a few things about that
 JUSTICE BREYER: As long as there was another member, you could -- you could do it
 But without that remaining member, you can't
 MR
 KATYAL: So the first thing to say about that argument, Justice Breyer, and it's one that 
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes
  
 MR
 KATYAL: -- it is a totally different argument
 It really does rest on the first sentence of (b)
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes
 Yes
 MR
 KATYAL: And my friend admitted, it's a totally new, different argument
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes
 MR
 KATYAL: It's not in the question presented
 It's not before the Court
 But were the Court interested in it, I do think that the language of 
the quorum provision, "quorum" meaning a number 
sufficient to transact business, is the most relevant 
language, and that suggests that two is enough so long 
as you have that initial delegation to a group of three 
and then one member drops off
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, don't -- don't you think it is significant that the -- the vacancy clause 
that you were discussing -- where is it? It's in (b)
 "A vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of 
the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of 
the board
" And it says nothing about a vacancy in the group not impairing the power of the group
 MR
 KATYAL: JUSTICE SCALIA: Which -- which buttresses, it seems to me, the argument that when the group is no 
 longer a group of three the delegation is no longer 
effective
 MR
 KATYAL: I don't think so
 The -- the language is "A vacancy in the board -- in the board 
shall not impair the powers of the remaining members of 
the board
" JUSTICE SCALIA: Of the board
 MR
 KATYAL: Of the board
 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't say that about the group
 That's my point
 MR
 KATYAL: Well, but by definition, Justice Scalia, the members that had been delegated this 
power on December th are members of the board
 And they are not -- they are not simply extraneous actors
 
JUSTICE SCALIA: No
 The -- this whole passage distinguishes between the board and the group
 
I mean, it's -- it doesn't -- it doesn't mean the group 
when it says "the board" and the board when it says "the 
group
" MR
 KATYAL: Well, I think it -- I don't know that there is a distinction
 I think that there when they say the board, it by definition includes the 
group, because that is part of the board
 They aren't extraneous individuals
  
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, go ahead; finish
 JUSTICE SCALIA: The quorum for the group should be three, then
 Right? MR
 KATYAL: The quorum -- well, except that, Justice Scalia, it says -- it goes on to say that 
the quorum is actually two
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let -- let's say the board delegates to a group the authority to act as the 
board until December st, 
 And on December th, , the group delegates to itself because it's acting 
as the board the authority to act until December , 

 Is that valid? MR
 KATYAL: Well, if -- if the initial CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All the powers of the board until December st
 MR
 KATYAL: And then -- then I take it, yes, they could exercise that delegation
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So a delegee can delegate to itself the full authority of the -- the 
master in the master -agent relationship? MR
 KATYAL: Under the statute
 Now, there 
 may be other problems with it
 So (a), which is found in our brief, in our government brief at page a, 
sets out, for example, removal for cause
 And if some CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no; they are just -- you know, they make the distinction that the 
board should continue to function
 MR
 KATYAL: Yes
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though their MR
 KATYAL: Right
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- they, acting as a board, get to delegate to themselves as the group the 
authority to go beyond that
 MR
 KATYAL: Right
 I suppose that -- I mean, it's not presented here but yes, I suppose that 
would be permissible
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, what if the board, consisting of five members -- let's say three 
Democrats and two Republicans -- the three Democrats 
delegate to a group the authority to act as a board
 
They designate themselves as the members of the group
 
They have at that point, authorized themselves to act as 
the board with as little as two members, even though 
they couldn't have done that as members of the board
  
 MR
 KATYAL: I think that's right, Mr
 Chief Justice, and it underscores that the statute 
itself can't control all of those problems and whether 
you set the quorum at three or two, even if you have a 
full board of five, you can have these machinations that 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though the whole -- even though the whole purpose of expanding from 
three to five was to ensure that more than two are 
required for the board to act? MR
 KATYAL: Well, I think that the purpose, as the legislative history reveals, and it's set out in 
our brief, was to increase efficiency and to have 
overlapping panels adjudicating cases
 I do think that there's a -- there's ways to prevent your situation from 
happening; that, and they include not just removal for 
cause, which I think this would be the paradigmatic case 
if three members of the body were trying to cut out two 
members from doing their job
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not trying to, but succeeding in doing so
 MR
 KATYAL: Succeeding, absolutely
 And I CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, it depends upon who would remove them for cause
 
 MR
 KATYAL: Absolutely
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, who would remove them? MR
 KATYAL: It would be the president
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if he's perfectly content to have two Democrats? MR
 KATYAL: And then you would have other -- you would have other checks as well
 If you had one-party government and all of these factors 
aligning in the way you are suggesting, you would have 
the possibility that the circuit court's review under 
(f) might come into play, I mean, because each board 
decision can be potentially appealed to a circuit court
 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I just want to make sure there is nothing to constrain -- if you have three 
Democrats, three -- or two Republicans or, of course, 
the other way around, nothing to constrain them from 
acting fully as the board with only two -- two 
Democrats? MR
 KATYAL: I don't think the statute CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the statute
 MR
 KATYAL: -- under either my friend's reading or mine
 I think that rather, it is a matter of 
 etiquette, practice, tradition, and all sorts of 
institutional checks that are laced into the way in 
JUSTICE BREYER: this is what -- one thing, if I were thinking without 
the language for a moment, and I -- the Taft-Hartley 
Congress did, I think, want to limit the powers in a 
number of ways of the board, maybe expand the membership 
to be sure there would be both parties in larger 
numbers
 If you could limit this to adjudications, you would say, well, then they can't set major policy 
with just two members
 But I don't see a way to do that, particularly since the board has often set rules 
in adjudication which have broad application
 So am I right in thinking that we have to decide either, it is okay for two members to set the 
most major policies, or we have to say they can't even 
conduct adjudication, even the simplest adjudication, 
even the least significant? MR
 KATYAL: I think -- I think, Justice Breyer, that the board traditionally doesn't engage in 
much rulemaking
 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no
 But that is a rule
  
 MR
 KATYAL: And I do agree that -- that at stake here is the potential to decide cases
 Now, when you mention the Taft-Hartley Act, I think that that 
legislative history is important for a different reason, 
which is up in -- from  to , and this is set out 
in footnote  of our brief, that board decided over 
 cases as a two-member body
 There was a vacant third position
 And there were  years of debate, contentious debate, as you alluded to before, about 
Taft-Hartley, and yet they left that piece intact
 They permitted two-member bodies to decide these cases
 And so to the extent legislative history is relevant for 
members of the Court, we suggest it strongly suggests 
that what the board did here, faced with this vacancy 
JUSTICE ALITO: JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose our first inquiry were agency law, and we concluded that 
under agency law when the principal ceases to exist the 
agent may no longer function
 Let's assume we conclude that under agency law
 Could you then cite us a case or a rationale for saying that agency law should not apply 
to a government agency, to a problem of this type, and 
if so, what is your authority? 
 MR
 KATYAL: Sir, they are set out at page  of our brief
 They are United States v
 Wyder, the two Donovan cases
 I think it is a long-established principle that principal/agent relationships, which we 
don't think necessarily apply to this case, but even did 
you -- even were you to disagree, as the premise of your 
question suggested, that government delegations survive 
the loss of that principal
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is your point that official acts done stay in effect even though the 
official is gone, until the official's successor in 
office is appointed and that successor can remand the 
instruction? MR
 KATYAL: That's -- that's precisely correct
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that is like the de facto officer doctrine
 It could be that, if the Petitioner prevails here, the de facto officer doctrine 
would leave in place everything that has been done
 MR
 KATYAL: JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me that's quite a different -- different point
 MR
 KATYAL: Absolutely
 That's a different point
 What I'm saying and what these cases say is 
 that, for example, when an attorney general designates 
their power to -- the wiretap authority to a 
subordinate, an assistant attorney general, and then 
that attorney general leaves office, that wiretap 
authority nonetheless continues in the subordinate until 
it is revoked by a successor
 JUSTICE ALITO: But hasn't the situation that has prevailed now for some time changed the -- the 
decision-making process of the board in at least two 
important ways? First, there isn't any opportunity for full board review of cases
 But more important, if you have only two members on the board and only two members 
on the panel, the process is very different from a panel 
in which there were three members, or in which two 
members can be supplemented with an additional member if 
they can't agree
 What are the two to do? they have to split the difference all the time
 And 
basically have suggested that that's exactly what has 
happened
 MR
 KATYAL: Justice Alito, I am not here suggesting that the two-member board is ideal or 
equivalent or optimal to a -- an optimal thing
 
Congress set out five
 But faced with a vacancy crisis  
 and shutting down the board entirely, I think the board 
did the prudent thing here by continuing to operate, 
continuing for these  or so days to decide these 
cases
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, not only is the two-member board not -- not ideal
 Do you think it is reasonably possible that Congress back in  
contemplated this particular problem and would have 
solved it the way you suggest? MR
 KATYAL: I do think that Congress had before it a well -- it was well-known that over  
times the board had decided cases with only two members, 
with the third being vacant
 JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's always when there is -- there is in existence three people who could 
have served
 But the particular problem we've got now, going on for  or  years: All the decisions by two members
 Do you think Congress would have authorized this? MR
 KATYAL: As opposed to shutting down the entire board, yes, Justice Stevens
 I think that's the JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends
 I mean, if shutting down is the only way to put pressure on 
Congress to -- I mean, you may have a Congress that is  
 just delighted to have only two Democratic members left 
on the board and all the cases decided by two Democratic 
members
 What possible incentive does that Congress have to increase the board to -- to the level that it 
should be? None
 If you want to solve the crisis that you are so worried about, the only way to solve it is to say: 
Boy, you know, there is -- it's Armageddon coming; we 
are going to not be able to act at all
 That would solve the crisis
 MR
 KATYAL: Well, I think the politics in Armageddon could cut different ways, depending -- I 
mean, these are nomination battles that are focused on 
individual personalities
 And, Justice Scalia, the only empirical evidence we have -- this is not the first time 
the board has done this, contrary to my friend's 
suggestion earlier
 In , the board was faced with the exact same situation
 The board was going to go down to two members
 They decided to do the exact same delegation and give -- give all the powers to a group of three, and 
four days later, Congress fixed the problem with the 
president
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm much more impressed by -- by your opponent's assertion, which I don't think  
 you have contradicted, that for many years whenever 
there was a death in one of the three-member panels, 
that panel was reconstituted
 A new person was appointed, instead of just letting it continue to 
operate with only two
 Doesn't that mean something? Doesn't that suggest that these panels were viewed by 
the board as requiring three people? MR
 KATYAL: No, it suggests that they thought three was optimal, where it was -- where they 
could get three bodies
 But here, when they only have two -- and again, faced with shutting down and not 
deciding the lion's share of cases, which aren't the 
controversial ones that give rise to the disagreement, 
Justice Alito, that you were positing -- they've decided 
to go and do it -- and do their business and try and 
resolve these
 And they have done, I think -- the corpus reveals a really remarkable job at reaching agreement in 
a large number of cases on the basis of existing 
precedent
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How -- how has it -- how has it worked? And I understand that they are not dealing with controversial decisions
 How many decisions are there now? MR
 KATYAL: I believe that there is  or  
 so decisions that they have rendered, and of those they 
have set aside about approximately 
 It was  as of a few days ago and it's gone up, because they involve 
questions about overturning precedent or novel issues, 
and so they haven't reached agreement in those
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What actually happens on -- on the ground? Somebody complains about an unfair labor practice to the board, and let's say the 
petitioner prevails and the board can't function
 What happens next? Is there -- I don't know if there would be a review or not, but can you go to the court of 
appeals? MR
 KATYAL: If -- if -- if the board is disabled? CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, assume there is no board
 As you say, the -- the problem that would happen if you don't prevail? MR
 KATYAL: Well, if there is -- if there is no board, then I take it the cases would get stuck 
after the ALJ
 There is nothing to take exception to, and so I'm not sure they could go directly to the court 
of appeals, because the statute, (f), I think, 
doesn't permit review from an ALJ decision directly up
 
It permits review only of the board's decisions
 And if there is no board decision, then presumably these cases  
 get stuck until we have a three-member quorum
 JUSTICE BREYER: And is it -- is it correct numerically that, in fact, under identical language 

from  to , there were two-member panels and they 
decided about  cases, and then they took the same 
language, and now since , roughly, what are the 
figures? How many cases? Has it only been this instance where it has been two members or have there 
been other instances? MR
 KATYAL: Well, the -- the board only went down to two members as a whole starting in 
 
It has happened four times: In  for  months; in , I believe for  month; in  for only a few 
days
 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that when the  cases that you are talking about were? MR
 KATYAL: The  cases were between  and 
 JUSTICE BREYER: And 
 And how many cases were decided by two members about, I'm not asking 
for -- during the times you are talking about before the 
present two-member boards? MR
 KATYAL: In -- in -- in  and in , the board didn't do this, because those were short  
 periods of time
 In , they did do precisely what they did here, but Congress resolved the situation, so 
there are only about  cases decided in that -day 
period
 And now from  to now, approximately  cases or so have been decided
 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they never did it when they had a full board? MR
 KATYAL: JUSTICE SCALIA: Whenever there was a death of one of the members of a three-judge panel or a 
three-member panel, they filled it and the panel did not 
operate with two? MR
 KATYAL: Absolutely
 We are not JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though it could have, even though the quorum provision was just as it is here
 MR
 KATYAL: JUSTICE SCALIA: Those panels did not operate with two? MR
 KATYAL: Absolutely
 It's not optimal, Justice Scalia, to have two
 But if -- if the choice is shutting down or going with two, the board made the 
choice in this circumstance to go with more
 And, Justice Breyer, you had mentioned before the change in the word "except that," and I do  
 think that that is crucial language, because that is a 
subordinating conjunction
 And what it does is essentially modify that
 The two-member quorum language JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you need the "except that" once you have language
 You need it because now you have a bigger board and it says there is a 
three-member quorum
 MR
 KATYAL: Precisely
 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought they -- they simply are taking the earlier phrase, the earlier 
statutory phrase, and they are changing those words 
because grammatically you now need it? MR
 KATYAL: Precisely correct
 You need it grammatically because otherwise if you didn't have 
something like that, it would suggest that the panel 
quorum would be three as well
 But -- but the language is quite specific on this and, contrary to what the D
C
 
Circuit found, "at all times" is modified by that 
subordinating conjunction in the phrase that follows
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what authority does an ALJ purport and in fact exercise? He's not acting or she's not acting for the board? MR
 KATYAL: The -- the ALJ is appointed by the board and they essentially write tentative decisions  
 that the board, as I understand it, can approve or 
disapprove
 Exceptions can be taken by litigants up to the board
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under the Petitioner's theory, if there is no quorum would those appointments 
then be invalidated, too? MR
 KATYAL: Well, I -- and this goes to Justice Scalia's first question of the argument, I -- I 
think that it's possible
 I think that there is -- the D
C
 Circuit's reasoning is -- potentially could be read so broadly as to say that the entire board goes poof and 
everything under it, including the salaries
 I think if the Court were inclined to -- to write a decision like that, we would try to look to, as 
you mentioned before, the de facto officer doctrine and 
the specific language of the delegations to the ALJ's 
and the specific language to the general counsels, to 
try to see if there is a way to preserve all of the 
board's action in this circumstance
 Of course, that isn't before the Court at this point, but I understand that the dramatic 
consequences, potentially dramatic consequences of the D
C
 Circuit's ruling, may inform the judgment
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do we have any notion when -- when the board will reduce to one?  
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE SCALIA: When -- when -- when is one of the two's term over? MR
 KATYAL: In the absence of any further confirmations or other appointments, one of the members, 
Member Schaumber, will leave on August th of this 
year
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of this year
 At which point there will be some pressure on Congress, I guess, 
right? MR
 KATYAL: There will
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are -- there are two nominees, are there not? MR
 KATYAL: There are three nominees pending right now
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Three? MR
 KATYAL: Yes
 And they have been pending
 They were named in July of last year
 They were voted out of committee in October
 One of them had a hold and had to be renominated
 That renomination took place
 There was a failed quorum -- a failed cloture vote in February
 And so all three nominations are pending
 And I think that underscores the general contentious nature of the appointment process with 
respect to this set of issues
 
Official individuals
 How would that be different than the Cuba situation? MR
 COLE: Well, then, if it's -- if it's traveling for the purpose of association, then it would 
be targeted at association, not at the conduct of 
travel
 The whole --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's no different than the Cuba situation
 MR
 COLE: No, but the whole point of the Cuba -- the Cuba travel cases is that -- again, as this 
Court said, it was an across-the-board ban
 It did not apply to different political groups
 It applied to anyone who sought to travel to Cuba
 And it was about travel
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose it's a ban just for travel to meet with terrorist organizations, 
Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical
 MR
 COLE: Right
 Well, then I think -- I think that's -- that™s different from this case, right, 
because this case -- suppose it's a ban on speech 
wherever it occurs
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what about the -- what about the hypothetical? MR
 COLE: Right
 Well, with respect to the hypothetical, I think the question, Your Honor, would be  
Official whether the government's interest in banning that travel 
is unrelated to the associational or speech purposes
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's what the Chief Justice says: In any context, support ultimately will inure to the benefit of a terrorist organization, and we 
have a governmental interest in not allowing that
 MR
 COLE: There's no -- there™s no dispute, Your Honor, that the government has a compelling interest 
in cutting off aid to terrorism
 The question is whether it can do so by criminalizing pure speech
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it hasn't criminalized speech
 It has criminalized providing aid and assistance to these organizations
 Most of that aid and assistance that is prohibited is not in the form of 
speech, but it happens to include speech as well
 MR
 COLE: Right, but, Justice Scalia --JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that™s quite different from a law that is directed explicitly at 
speech
 MR
 COLE: Well, I don™t -- I think it's not in this -- in this sense, Justice Scalia
 Imagine a statute that banned aid to overthrow the United States 
Government
 And it had three provisions: One, you can't assassinate the president; two, you can't provide bombs and 
weapons to groups attempting to overthrow the government;  
Official three, you can't advocate overthrow of the government
 
If that were applied to someone for speaking in advocacy, 
we wouldn't say it's a regulation of speech
 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not the right --that's not the right number three
 The right number three is you cannot advise and assist an organization 
that is seeking to overthrow the government
 That's what is at issue here, not --MR
 COLE: Well, but --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- not independently promoting the objectives of these terrorist organizations
 Your --your clients are free to do that
 MR
 COLE: Well --JUSTICE SCALIA: But when they assist the organization by providing advice, that's a different 
matter
 MR
 COLE: Well, the government says if they -- even if they speak in conjunction with the group, 
they -- and they™re providing a benefit to the government, 
that's prohibited
 So, for example --JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay
 When they provide a benefit, right? MR
 COLE: So, for example, under that view, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the L
A
 Times, 
all of which published op-eds by Hamas spokespersons -- 
Official Hamas is on the list -- thereby providing a benefit to 
Hamas, working with the Hamas spokesperson, they™re all 
criminals
 President Carter --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we -- we can cross that bridge when we come to it
 MR
 COLE: But --JUSTICE SCALIA: This is an as-applied challenge, and we are talking about the kind of advice 
and assistance that your clients want to give
 MR
 COLE: Right, and, Your Honor, there's no --JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a New York Times editorial
 MR
 COLE: Well, it is, though
 It is, Your Honor
 I mean, it™s -- Ralph Fertig is not the New York Times, and he's not President Carter, but it's the same 
sort of support, right? President Carter --JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no
 No, no
 I thought that he was -- he wants to meet with the people
 The New York Times didn't meet with Hamas to tell them how 
great their editorial was
 MR
 COLE: No, but it's not about -- it's not about whether you meet with them
 It's about whether you coordinate with them, and they've certainly 
coordinated with the Hamas spokesperson in editing and  
Official accepting and then publishing his editorial
 That is --that would be providing a service
 It would --JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on what "coordinating" means, doesn't it? And we can determine that in the next case
 MR
 COLE: Well, let me -- let me also answer it this way, Justice Scalia: If you look at the specific speech which our clients seek to engage in, it 
includes writing and distributing literature in 
conjunction with the Kurdistan Workers Party in the 
United States advocating their support
 How is that different from the New York Times? JUSTICE BREYER: Supposing that -- what you say is you want to engage in political advocacy on 
behalf of the Kurds
 That's your words
 All right
 Suppose -- and these are two hypotheticals
 Hypothetical one, your clients, let's say, or some other people, 
know that what the Kurds' hypothetical plan is, is to 
pretend they're a political advocacy organization, 
but to go around shooting the people who don't agree 
with them
 Okay? Case one, the hypothetical defendant knows it
 In case two, he doesn't know it, but it's true
 MR
 COLE: Well, I think -- I think if you -- if you specifically intend and know that your aid 
will further the group in its terrorist activities, then  
Official it's not protected speech
 But if you're -- if you don't know that and you don't intend that, and in this 
case --JUSTICE ALITO: And that goes for all forms of training? No form of training or expert assistance can be prohibited unless the individual specifically intends 
to further -- that the training will be used to carry 
out terrorist activities? MR
 COLE: Well, Justice Alito, this is an as-applied challenge
 So the question simply is whether training in what international human rights consist of, 
in how to advocate for international human rights, and 
how to advocate politically in Congress and other bodies
 
That's the speech that's at issue here
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, just out of curiosity, I thought your position was that no form of training or 
assistance could be prohibited -- -MR
 COLE: No, I was just --JUSTICE ALITO: -- consistent with the First Amendment
 That's not your position? MR
 COLE: No
 I think -- I think, again, it depends upon the form of speech
 There may be some forms of training that are so closely connected to the -- to 
the end that Congress seeks to -- legitimately seeks to 
proscribe, like training in bombmaking or training in  
Official military exercises
 JUSTICE SCALIA: The end that Congress seeks to proscribe is the existence of these terrorist 
organizations
 And the theory of the legislation is that when you aid any of their enterprises you™re 
aiding the organization
 Hamas, for example, gained support among -- among the Palestinians by activities 
that are perfectly lawful, perhaps running hospitals, 
all sorts of things
 MR
 COLE: Right
 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that is what fosters the terrorist organization and enables the terrorist 
activities
 Why isn't that a reasonable connection? Any assistance you provide to these organizations cannot 
be separated from assistance to their terrorist 
activities
 MR
 COLE: Right
 Well, Your Honor, that is precisely the argument that the United States 
made to this Court in Scales
 And here I™m quoting from the government's brief: "Active membership can be proscribed even though the activity be expended along 
lines not otherwise illegal, since active support of any 
kind aids the organization in achieving its own illegal 
purposes
" That was with respect to an organization  
Official that Congress spent  years studying, made findings 
that it was an international conspiracy directed and 
controlled by the Soviet Union with the aim of 
overthrowing the United States by force and violence, 
using terrorism
 And, nonetheless, this Court in Scales held you've got to distinguish between that aid and 
support and membership which is furthering the lawful 
activities and that which is furthering the illegal 
activities; otherwise you are penalizing the exercise of 
lawful speech
 The Court said the same thing in De Jonge
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Cole, as I remember, Scales upheld a conviction, wasn™t --MR
 COLE: It did, Justice Ginsburg, but only because it interpreted the statute to be -- to be 
limited to specific -- to members -- active membership 
that is specifically intended to further the illegal 
ends of the group, precisely --JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it didn™t -- it was not a statute which involves banning financial or other tangible 
support, and page  of your brief made -- this is a 
difficult case for me
 And the second paragraph, page , you say: "The narrow focus of plaintiffs' claims in this Court means that the case does not involve the 
propriety of banning financial or other tangible  
Official support
" MR
 COLE: Right
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then you say: "Nor does it involve speech advocating or teaching criminal or violent 
activity
" But it does involve speech, let's say arguendo, that is tantamount to material support
 MR
 COLE: Well, I -- right, but --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the speech is tantamount to material support in that it legitimizes, 
encourages, or strengthens the organization
 MR
 COLE: Well, two things in response to that, Justice Kennedy
 First, that is what the United States argued in Scales
 And, again, the Court, not only in Scales but in a host of cases striking down 
Communist Party statute, said you have to distinguish 
between aid that™s intended to further lawful activity 
and aid that™s intended to further illegal activity 
when it's in the form of protected activity --
association, here speech and association
 And, secondly --
JUSTICE STEVENS: In those cases, the real question was whether membership was enough, wasn™t it? MR
 COLE: Active membership --JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes
  
Official MR
 COLE: -- which the government says constitutes more than mere nominal membership
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And this is support
 It's different
 MR
 COLE: Well, Your Honor, in De Jonge, one of these cases, one of this Court's first First 
Amendment cases, the government argued that Mr
 De Jonge 
aided the Communist Party in its illegal ends by 
conducting a meeting for them and being their lead 
speaker at the meeting
 And this Court said: We've got to look at what he did, and what -- yes, he conducted the 
meeting; yes, he was a member of the Communist Party; 
yes, he solicited people to join the Communist Party
 
But what did he do? He advocated lawful peaceable activities
 And this Court said --JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there wasn't a statute on the books that prohibited material support --MR
 COLE: Well, I don't think it would --JUSTICE KENNEDY: And here there is, and this is in aid of that prohibition
 MR
 COLE: Right, but Your Honor, what would -- if Congress came along after the Communist Party cases 
and said, okay, you've said we can't make it a crime to 
criminalize membership in the Communist Party; we are 
now going to make it a crime to speak in conjunction 
Official with the Communist Party -- do you think the 
decisions would have come out any differently? 
I don't think so, because this Court has said that 
speech is different from money, that it --JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's very unrealistic to compare these terrorist organizations 
with the Communist Party
 Those cases involved philosophy
 The Communist Party was -- was -- was more than a -- than an organization that -- that had some 
unlawful ends
 It was also a philosophy of -- of -- of extreme socialism
 And -- and many people subscribed to that philosophy
 I don't think that Hamas or any of these terrorist organizations represent such a philosophical 
organization
 MR
 COLE: Your Honor, this -- this Court accepted Congress's findings
 Congress's findings were not that this was a philosophical debating society, but 
that it was an international criminal conspiracy 
directed by our enemy to overthrow us through terrorism
 JUSTICE SCALIA: That may be, but people joined it for philosophical reasons
 MR
 COLE: Oh, sure --JUSTICE SCALIA: They joined it for philosophical reasons
 These terrorist organizations  
Official have very practical objectives
 And the only reason for joining them or assisting them is to assist those 
practical objectives
 MR
 COLE: Well, I don't think that's -- I don't think that's fair, Justice Scalia
 The Humanitarian Law Project has no interest in furthering 
terrorism, but the Kurdistan Workers Party are the 
principal representatives of the -- of the Kurds in 
Turkey
 They do have an interest in protecting the rights of the Kurds
 They do have an interest in encouraging the Kurdistan Workers Party to -- to disavow 
violence and engage in lawful peaceful means of 
resolving their disputes --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr
 Cole --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Cole, would you distinguish -- I think this came up in the court of 
appeals
 There are a lot of groups on the list
 I think the Al-Qaeda was one instance that was mentioned, 
and, at least according to the briefs, you conceded that 
if you wanted to do just what you describe with respect 
to the Kurdish group or the Tamil group, the ban would 
be permissible, if the group -- if the group were Al-Qaeda, 
and I™ll throw in the Taliban
 MR
 COLE: Yes
 We didn't actually concede that, Your Honor
 That's a misstatement on the part of  
Official the government
 If you look at the --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then -- then as --suppose the group is not the two that we have here --MR
 COLE: Right
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- but Al-Qaeda and the Taliban? MR
 COLE: Right
 What we said, for the record, is that it would pose a very different 
constitutional question
 And I think there are two reasons why it might pose a different constitutional 
question
 One is -- and that was -- I™m picking up on my question back to Mr
 Chief Justice, is it during wartime 
or not? And during wartime, Congress has broader powers pursuant to the treason --JUSTICE STEVENS: But I want to be sure I understand that point
 You think the issue in this case would be different if we were at war? MR
 COLE: I think it might be different if we were at war with these groups
 JUSTICE STEVENS: And if that's true, why aren't we now at war, with regard to our opposition to 
these organizations? MR
 COLE: Well --JUSTICE STEVENS: What is the difference, as a practical matter?  
Official MR
 COLE: Well -- well, two things, Your Honor
 With respect to -- it might be different if you -- if you™re talking about treason
 Tokyo Rose, for example, was engaged in speech, but she was doing so 
with -- with the purpose of aiding the enemy and the 
specific intent of betraying the United States
 And that's what's required
 And what the Supreme Court has said is that the -- the aid has to be to --JUSTICE STEVENS: But my question that I want to be sure you are focusing on --MR
 COLE: Yes
 JUSTICE STEVENS -- but in the issues in this very case --MR
 COLE: Right
 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- would they be different if we were now at war? MR
 COLE: I think it would depend, Your Honor, because the -- what -- what treason requires is 
aid to the enemy, and aid might be in the form of speech
 
But it also requires a specific intent to betray the 
United States
 And when you aid someone with whom we are at war, there is an -- there may well be an intent 
to betray the United States
 There is no betrayal of the United States here
 And, number two --
Official JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, in a way there is
 What about -- what about aiding organizations that are 
acting criminally, killing innocent civilians, with regard 
to one of our allies? And we™re seeking to gain the assistance of these allies against those terrorists who 
aim their terrorism at us, and yet --MR
 COLE: Right
 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- we -- we are supposed to allow our citizens to assist the terrorist organizations 
that are directing their violence against them? MR
 COLE: Well --JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't that a sufficiently serious reason for the government to do 
what it's done here? MR
 COLE: I think the question, Your Honor, is there -- is there any realistic nexus between writing 
an op-ed, advocating before Congress, urging a group to 
use lawful nonviolent means to resolve its disputes, and 
killing Americans? And there just isn't
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you've picked -- you've picked hypotheticals that are very easy 
for you
 What about personnel? Is there a connection between providing personnel that participate in legal 
activity on behalf of a terrorist organization, and the 
organization can then say, well, because you are 
Official providing this personnel, we can take them out and shift 
them to bombmaking? MR
 COLE: Right
 And -- and -- and I guess my answer to that would be it would depend upon whether 
the -- the -- what is being prohibited is speech
 If what is being prohibited is speech, I'm not sure that it 
would be permissible for the government to say we™re 
going to criminalize your speech, even though it™s 
advocating lawful activities, because --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of the things that™s being prohibited here that you challenge 
is providing personnel
 MR
 COLE: That's right
 And -- and that's exactly what De Jonge was essentially charged with
 And the Communist Party was, again, found to be engaged in 
criminal activity, to be a criminal syndicate, 
essentially, by the Oregon statute
 The Court didn't question that
 At that time it was illegal to even advocate illegal activity
 He was charged with providing his person, personnel, by conducting a meeting under the auspices of 
the Communist Party and providing the lead speech there
 
And the Court said, even though the argument was --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is your argument limited to personnel that engages in speech, or  
Official does it cover personnel that -- a nurse at one of the --
if there are any, Hamas hospitals? MR
 COLE: Right
 Our argument, Your Honor, is -- again, this is an as-applied challenge with respect to 
the particular speech that our clients seek to engage in, 
so it would not -- it would not require the Court to 
decide whether any nonspeech assistance could be 
proscribed
 In fact --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When -- but the way you define the speech that you want protected is speech that 
is advocating some lawful activity
 MR
 COLE: Right
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what™s unlawful about teaching people medicine and how to cure people 
from infection? MR
 COLE: If -- if that were what they were doing, Your Honor, if it was teaching, then it would be 
protected by the First Amendment
 But if -- I took Chief Justice Roberts's question --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you see no difference -- you™re not advocating a difference in 
this case between training that could reasonably be used 
in terrorist activities, because teaching people how to 
care for the ill could be used to teach people how to 
care for the wounded
  
Official MR
 COLE: Right
 Right
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right? And the political speech that your group is advocating, i
e
, 
the petitioning -- you™re not willing to draw a 
distinction? MR
 COLE: No, no
 I --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are saying to us the case stands and falls on whether or not we accept that 
this statute regulates conduct as opposed to speech? MR
 COLE: No
 Justice Sotomayor, what I'm suggesting is, number one, the statute regulates speech
 
It regulates speech because of what it conveys
 
Therefore, the --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, it regulates training
 And what -- the question I asked you --MR
 COLE: Yes
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- was whether there was a way in your challenge, or whether you are advocating 
any difference in the nature of the speech, that it's --
this is an as-applied challenge
 MR
 COLE: Yes
 Exactly
 And that's --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so the question --because the only answer you have given us is if it's 
lawful speech, it's protected
 MR
 COLE: No, I -- I think -- I think, Your 
Official Honor, that the answer -- maybe I wasn't clear in 
responding to Justice Alito
 But with respect to speech advocating solely lawful activity of the type at issue 
here, I think the connection between the government™s --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So give me an analytical framework to address that question
 MR
 COLE: All right
 Well, I --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The government says under O'Brien even the speech that you want -- forget 
about the tsunami aid speech
 Let's just talk about the political petitioning speech, the petitioning for --MR
 COLE: Right
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there a difference and under what analytical framework would we reach it? MR
 COLE: Well, I think the question -- the question at the -- at the -- at the bottom would be 
whether there is a sufficient connection between the 
speech which is being expressed and the government's 
compelling interest
 And if -- certainly there would be if it's -- meets Brandenburg
 I think there might be if it is specifically intended or known that it will further 
terrorist activity
 But where -- with respect to our speech, there's really no realistic likelihood that the 
speech that's being expressed here will further --JUSTICE KENNEDY: We have to be conscious of  
Official the white light
 I have just one -- one question
 The old equity rule was that you don't enjoin a criminal statute; you wait until something 
happens
 And the reason is then we have specific facts
 And if we said that here, you would say, oh, you™re 
chilling speech
 What's your best case in the precedents of this Court for our entertaining an challenge that --
this is not really -- we usually talk about as-applied 
after the fact
 Coates, there was a conviction
 MR
 COLE: Right
 Federal Election --JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your -- what's your best case? MR
 COLE: Federal Election Commission v
 Wisconsin Right to Life was a pre-enforcement, 
as-applied challenge to the provisions of the BCRA
 If I could reserve the rest of my time
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you want to give an answer to the Taliban and the Al-Qaeda? MR
 COLE: Oh, I'm sorry -- I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg
 I thought I was, and maybe --but the answer would be we are in a military conflict 
with the Al-Qaeda and the Taliban
 This Court has recognized that
 It™s authorized by the authorization to use military force
 Therefore, treason law might be  
Official applicable, number one
 Number two, it™s not clear that the Al-Qaeda engages in any lawful activities at all, and the -- the 
principle this Court established with respect to the 
Communist Party, a group that clearly engaged in illegal 
activities of a very, very dangerous kind, but also 
engaged in lawful activities, is that that™s -- that that 
the group has to be a dual-purpose group
 And here there™s absolutely no dispute that the Kurdistan 
Workers Party and the LTTE engage in a wide variety of 
lawful activities and that all our clients seek to do 
is support those lawful activities
 Thank you
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr
 Cole
 General Kagan
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN
 ELENA KAGAN ON BEHALF OF ERIC H
 HOLDER, JR
, ET AL
 GENERAL KAGAN: With your permission, Mr
 Chief Justice
 This may take some time
 (Laughter
) GENERAL KAGAN: I'm sure it will on the other side, too
 Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The material support statute is a vital weapon in this nation's continuing struggle against  
Official international terrorism
 The statute prohibits, in terms that ordinary people can understand, the provision 
of material resources, material resources of all kinds, 
to foreign groups that engage in terrorist acts that 
threaten the security of the United States or its 
citizens
 The statute does not prohibit in any way Petitioners' independent advocacy
 Petitioners can say or write whatever they wish about the PKK or the LTTE, 
and all their activities both legal and illegal
 What Petitioners --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If a terrorist was arrested in the United States from one of these groups, 
would they be barred under the statute from serving as 
their attorney in a U
S
 court? GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Sotomayor, if -- if there are --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that material support under the definition that you have been 
advocating? GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Sotomayor, I believe that that would be excluded from the statute -- should be 
excluded from the statute, and indeed even Petitioners 
have never suggested --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but I'm asking you why
  
Official GENERAL KAGAN: Because I think that there the canon of constitutional avoidance would clearly come 
into play
 If there is a criminal defendant, even a civil defendant where there may be Sixth Amendment 
issues, where there may be due process issues, it 
would --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so can I -- can I ask you something? I mean, part of the First Amendment is the right for the -- to petition the government for 
redress of grievances
 Putting aside all of the other aid they are claiming, the tsunami aid, the training and 
other things, can the statute constitutionally be read 
to bar them from petitioning legitimate agencies, 
legitimate government agencies, to peacefully, using the 
words of the Constitution, to effect legal change? GENERAL KAGAN: It can --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that -- that's part of what they™re claiming their speech involves --GENERAL KAGAN: The statute --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- training and doing that
 GENERAL KAGAN: The statute cannot legitimately be read to -- to include their independent 
advocacy
 But the statute, in fact, does not cover their independent advocacy
 Judge Fertig and all the rest of 
Official the Petitioners can lobby Congress, can lobby international organizations --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that doesn't --GENERAL KAGAN: -- as they see fit
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- answer -- what is the right of the people peaceably to assemble? Now, mind you, I understand this is the right of U
S
 citizens in 
the United States
 But what in the First Amendment or even in this statute could justify Congress from barring 
individuals to petition peacefully United -- world 
agencies or even U
S
 agencies --GENERAL KAGAN: Again, the statute --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- for the recognition of a -- of a legitimate goal? GENERAL KAGAN: Again, the statute does not prohibit the Petitioners from petitioning peacefully
 
What the statute does is to prohibit Petitioners from 
giving support to foreign terrorist organizations in 
their ability to petition international organizations
 
And that's a very different thing
 It's a different thing for several reasons
 First, remember that these are foreign organizations, and as several of you have suggested, the 
ability of Congress and of the Executive Branch to 
regulate the relationships between Americans and foreign  
Official governments or foreign organization has long been 
acknowledged by this Court
 It was acknowledged in cases like Regan and Zemel and others, not only with 
respect to nations with which we are at war, but with 
respect to foreign nations and other entities as well --
foreign nationals
 And in fact, the Petitioners' supposed First Amendment claims really are not speech claims at all
 
They are all association claims
 Petitioners can do whatever independent advocacy they wish
 What Petitioners cannot do is to provide support to a foreign 
terrorist organization
 And there, indeed, the government's position is that the Association Clause 
does not extend that far to give Americans, American 
citizens, the ability to deal in whatever way they wish 
with foreign nations --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it isn't--GENERAL KAGAN: -- or foreign organizations
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- whatever way they wish
 They™re making clear that it's only in connection with lawful activity of the group, and indeed 
it's to train them in using lawful means to achieve 
their end
 And I thought you went further than saying there has to be strictly independent advocacy
 You  
Official recognized in your brief that they could meet with 
members of these terrorist organizations
 They could meet and communicate with them, but they can't 
communicate advice on how to pursue their goals through 
lawful means? GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Ginsburg, you™re exactly right that, in addition to engaging in 
independent advocacy, Petitioners can meet with members 
of the foreign terrorist organizations, can join the 
foreign terrorist organizations, that membership is not 
prohibited by the statute
 What the statute does prohibit is active support of all kinds, both 
material --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can they -- can they advocate to the association? There are many kinds of advocacy
 You can advocate to the world that they are right
 Can you advocate to the association that you should change your ways, that you should use Lexis to 
find international law precedents, et cetera? GENERAL KAGAN: Absolutely, Justice Kennedy
 If -- if Judge Fertig or the other Petitioners wanted to 
say to these organizations, you should change your ways, 
nothing in the statute --JUSTICE KENNEDY: And suppose the organization's board of directors agrees with that and  
Official wants them to address the general membership on that 
point, and they are doing it with the blessing of the 
organization
 GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Kennedy, I want first -- I™m going to answer your question, and I™m 
going to say that that's still not covered, but I want 
also to make a general point, which is that this Court 
can exhaust all the hypotheticals that it has in this 
case, and it will be irrelevant to the case at hand, and 
that would be so for two reasons
 First, because with respect to overbreadth, all of those uncertain or even unconstitutional 
applications will be but a thimbleful, compared to the 
ocean full of completely legitimate applications of this 
statute
 And, second, because those hypotheticals have nothing to do with this case
 Mr
 Cole said several times, I heard, this is an as-applied challenge, this is an as-applied 
challenge
 And to the extent that the Court thinks that there are certain categories of activity that the 
statute could not prohibit that would raise serious 
constitutional concerns -- which I must say I -- I 
disagree with, but there may be some
 To the extent that that's true, the Court can -- can put those off to 
another day, another -- 
Official JUSTICE BREYER: Well, wait
 They want to apply
 They want to do --GENERAL KAGAN: I™m sorry
 JUSTICE BREYER: They say in this case that they want to provide training in the issue of 
humanitarian international law, and they want to provide 
training and expert advice and assistance in respect to 
how you petition the UN
 Now focusing on those two things, and going back to Justice Sotomayor's question, why -- what is the 
government's interest in the following? Under O'Brien or any other test, you look at it and say, does teaching 
have a First Amendment interest -- training? Yes
 And what about teaching about advocacy? That's what they are doing, teaching about a certain kind of advocacy
 
Yes
 Therefore there is a First Amendment interest implicated, seriously
 Now, when that is seriously implicated, there is also a government interest, on the other side, 
in not having terrorism
 But there is a less restrictive alternative which they suggest, that in that 
situation, what they're entitled to read this statute as 
saying is that, if they believe and a person reasonably 
would believe that their teaching, assistance, 
training, would not significantly aid this organization 
Official in its unlawful ends, then they are not guilty
 Now, what is the government's interest in not accepting that interpretation? The First Amendment is hurt; there is an interest; but there is what they 
describe as -- and what I have narrowed -- a less 
restrictive way of going about it
 And they have to be reasonable in what they think
 Now, what's the objection to that? GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Breyer, I think the objection is exactly what Justice Kennedy suggested with 
his hypothetical, because his hypothetical is actually 
perfectly aligned with this case
 You can't give tsunami aid, but the question is: Can you instruct these organizations about how to get tsunami aid? And then these organizations get tsunami aid, and they, in fact, use that aid in such a way that 
they also have more money to --JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry
 I™m not talking about tsunami aid
 I am talking about the instance where the teaching is itself teaching about how 
to do something, and that something is the kind of thing 
that the First Amendment protects
 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, that something, which is the teaching the foreign terrorist organization how 
to petition international bodies in order to get various  
Official kinds of support, financial or otherwise, that will 
strengthen those organizations in everything that they 
do
 What Congress decided --JUSTICE BREYER: Fine, and if a reasonable person would know that, that it's going to help them, 
then it is unlawful, if it's going to help them and a 
reasonable person would think it was going to help them 
in their unlawful activities
 But we're not --GENERAL KAGAN: Congress was the reasonable person here
 And Congress reasonably decided that when you help a terrorist -- foreign terrorist organization's 
legal activities, you™re also helping the foreign 
terrorist organization's illegal activities
 Hezbollah builds bombs
 Hezbollah also builds homes
 What Congress decided was when you help Hezbollah build homes, you are also helping Hezbollah 
build bombs
 That's the entire theory behind this statute, and it's a reasonable theory for exactly the 
kinds of reasons that Justice Kennedy was suggesting by 
that hypothetical
 JUSTICE ALITO: And doesn't that lead to --kind of logically lead to the conclusion that mere 
membership could be prohibited? Could you explain how someone could be a member of one of these organizations 
without providing a service to the organization? Simply  
Official by lending one's name as a member -- that might be 
regarded as a service
 If you attended a meeting and you helped to arrange the chairs in advance or clean up 
afterwards, you™d be providing a service to the 
organization
 GENERAL KAGAN: I -- I actually don't think -- I mean, Congress clearly did not mean to 
include that
 And I think that the normal words that Congress used make that pretty clear
 When you think about personnel, when you think about training, when you 
think about expert advice and assistance, even when you 
think about service, you -- the notion that I am serving 
a terrorist organization simply by the act of membership 
I think would not be correct
 And --JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say Congress clearly did not intend that? You know, I would have guessed that you are providing a service or personnel 
when you make yourself a member of the organization
 
Why do you say Congress clearly did not intend it? GENERAL KAGAN: That is certainly not the way the government reads the statute, and that's not the 
way the government has ever read the statute
 And, indeed, the government, as we discussed in our brief, 
believes that there are certain kinds of joint 
activities that would be allowed by the statute
  
Official Now, that's not to say that Congress could not have gone farther
 In this specific context, where one is regulating dealings with a foreign organization, 
it's possible that Congress could have gone further
 
But we understand the statute and -- and I think there's 
a -- I think, quite reasonably, as providing only 
material support, a true service, something that will 
help the foreign organization in whatever it does
 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but petitioning the United Nations -- and that's what you are teaching them 
-- does not, on its face, seem to me to be something 
that reasonably you would think was going to aid them in 
their unlawful objectives, but for the realm of ideas
 
Now --GENERAL KAGAN: This would be --JUSTICE BREYER: -- and then Congress put a thing in here which says: Don't construe this statute in a way that will abridge First Amendment rights
 So it's aware of the problem of First Amendment rights
 GENERAL KAGAN: And I think you are exactly right about that
 JUSTICE BREYER: And is there any evidence that something like that would, in fact, but for the realm of 
ideas, help this organization commit its terrorist acts? GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Breyer, I believe 
Official that the legislative record is quite clear that Congress 
thought that various kinds of aid given to the legal and 
legitimate activities of the terrorist organization, in 
fact, further the aims of the -- in fact, further the 
illegal and illegitimate goals
 Congress made findings about the fungibility of these resources
 Congress said over and over that these organizations have no firewalls, no organizational 
firewalls --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- but you --GENERAL KAGAN: -- no financial firewalls
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You say that the -- not only the membership, but they can meet and they can 
discuss
 And I don't understand the line between meeting with these terrorist organizations, discussing 
things with them, and instructing them on how they can 
pursue their goals through lawful means
 GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Ginsburg, I agree with you that there may be some hard cases that are at 
the borderline between the two, as there are in most 
statutes; that there may be hard cases
 This is not one of them
 And I think it would -- it's very instructive for the Court -- I'm sure you™ve all done 
this -- but to actually go back and look at the  
Official Petitioners™ complaints in this case and look at Judge 
Fertig's declarations in this case, because what they 
show is the extensiveness of the activities that they --
of the services that they wish to offer to these foreign 
terrorist organizations and the value that those 
services are going to give those foreign terrorist 
organizations
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General, you've talked about -- there has been a lot of discussion about 
the legitimate activities allowing -- facilitating 
illegitimate activities by freeing up personnel and all 
that, and legitimizing the group
 Is that an argument you've made before this Court or below? I looked at your briefs, and I thought it's almost all about: This is O'Brien, this is conduct, this is not speech
 I didn't see the argument that we've spent a lot of time talking about, which is 
the legitimate activities allow the illegitimate 
activities to take place
 GENERAL KAGAN: No, I believe we -- we have, Mr
 Chief Justice, although if we didn't emphasize it 
enough, I -- I will plead error, because I think that it 
is an -- a crucial point to this case
 But I think in the part of our brief --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have -- I  
Official don't mean to -- do you have particular references to 
where in your brief you made the argument? GENERAL KAGAN: Yes
 In the part of our brief where we discuss the application of the O'Brien 
standard, and we say what are the governmental interests 
there
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I know
 It seems to me your case is all about O'Brien
 I'm not sure you have an answer to whether or not strict scrutiny is 
satisfied
 If we disagree with you and think that some of this activity is speech, I don't see the argument 
that you've presented on strict scrutiny
 GENERAL KAGAN: I think that that™s right, Mr
 Chief Justice, that we have not specifically 
addressed the strict scrutiny argument
 I think this would pass a strict scrutiny standard, but I actually 
think that to the extent that the Court thought a strict 
scrutiny standard were appropriate, a remand might be in 
order, that no Court has ever actually gone off on that 
ground, that --JUSTICE ALITO: Why is O'Brien the correct standard? How can you argue that training and providing advice is not speech? GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Alito, I think that the -- the training and advice clauses are, of course,  
Official part of a statute which regulates material support and 
resources of all kinds, and to the extent that what 
you're saying is, you know, training and advice, those 
are always speech restrictions if you find them in a 
statute, I think that that's not right
 I mean, if you think about the range of things that training can involve: Training how to build a bomb, training how to fly a plane, training how 
to use sophisticated communications equipment, and 
training how to engage --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about training to --JUSTICE GINSBURG: What's involved here -- I think they said that they want to train them 
how to do lawful things, how to pursue their goals in a 
lawful, rather than a terrorist, way
 And that is speech
 It is not conduct
 They want to engage in advocacy of peaceful means of achieving the goals of 
these groups
 GENERAL KAGAN: Congress, of course, allowed them to engage in all the advocacy that they wish on 
behalf of these groups
 Indeed, Congress did not prohibit --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they want to communicate, and you say they can communicate
 And I still am having trouble with the line of what they can  
Official communicate and what they can't
 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, I think if they are engaged in just discussion of ideas, this statute does 
not prohibit that
 What the statute prohibits is the provision of actual support, services to the 
organizations that the organization can use in its 
activities, both legal and illegal
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you stick with the argument made below that it's unlawful to file an amicus 
brief? GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Kennedy --JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think I'm right in saying it that that was the argument below
 GENERAL KAGAN: Yes, I think that would be a service
 In other words, not an amicus brief just to make sure that we understand each other
 The Petitioners can file amicus briefs in a case that might 
involve the PKK or the LTTE for themselves, but to the 
extent that a lawyer drafts an amicus brief for the PKK 
or for the LTTE, that that's the amicus party, then that 
indeed would be prohibited
 That's the kind of service that --JUSTICE STEVENS: Then it seems to me that your opponent's argument here today is prohibited
 GENERAL KAGAN: No, no, no, because  
Official Petitioners here are arguing for themselves
 What I'm suggesting is Petitioners can do all the advocacy they 
want, can engage in courts in any way they wish
 The only thing that's prohibited is if the PKK hired a 
lawyer to write an amicus brief on its behalf
 At that point --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, I understand, I could be wrong, that many petitioners or respondents 
go out to the industry and say we need some amicus 
briefs, and they flood in from all sides
 Would that be illegal? Because the -- the organization --GENERAL KAGAN: Well, if the PKK --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- came out and said we need a brief -- amicus briefs from law professors? 
From --GENERAL KAGAN: If -- if the PKK or the LTTE or Al-Qaeda or any of the other organizations on this 
list said we want amicus briefs, and somebody provided 
an amicus brief --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Without pay
 GENERAL KAGAN: -- for themselves -- for themselves, there would be no problem
 The only problem is if somebody drafted an amicus brief --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How can we can ever separate -- 
Official GENERAL KAGAN: -- for the PKK itself
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under the definition of this statute, teaching these members to play the 
harmonica would be unlawful
 You are teaching --training them in a lawful -- in a specialized activity
 
So how do we -- there has to be something more than 
merely a congressional finding that any training is bad
 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, I think here we have the congressional definition of what kind of training 
is bad, and that definition focuses on training in 
specialized activities
 Now, you say, well, maybe training a -- playing a harmonica is a specialized 
activity
 I think the first thing I would say is there are not a whole lot of people going around trying to 
teach Al-Qaeda how to play harmonicas
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, Mohammed Atta and his harmonica quartet might tour the country and make a lot 
of money
 Right? GENERAL KAGAN: I'm sorry
 I --(Laughter
) GENERAL KAGAN: But I don't mean to make fun of the hypothetical at all, Justice Sotomayor, because I 
think you™re raising an important point, but it's 
really a point that goes to how to sensibly read a 
statute
 What Congress did, when in response to some 
Official lower court decisions, it further clarified and defined the word ﬁtrainingﬂ and the word ﬁexpert advice and 
assistance,ﬂ I have to say I think that Congress's own 
responses here -- I mean, they -- Congress was both 
responsive and responsible, that it really took into 
account court decisions and tried to go back to the 
statute and --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, in that -- on the --just forget the harmonica for a second; I'm more worried 
about the lawyer
 You™re saying that a -- a group abroad which may have some American citizens in it -- let's assume 
they do -- want to hire a lawyer
 And this lawyer is supposed to file some amicus briefs and do other activities
 You™re saying Congress has forbidden that in this statute, and that's constitutional? GENERAL KAGAN: Well, first of all, Justice Breyer, I want to sort of repeat the -- what I -- what I said about the need to find a substantial amount 
of uncertain or unconstitutional applications, or with 
respect to any kind of facial challenge or with respect 
to this challenge --JUSTICE BREYER: But I want to know if that's what you™re saying, what I just said: that an organization has American citizens, engages in 
terrible stuff, but they are not entitled under the  
Official Constitution to have a lawyer in the United States who 
does legal work like filing amicus briefs
 GENERAL KAGAN: To the extent that there is any constitutional claim that they would be entitled to 
representation, whether it's a Sixth Amendment claim or 
a due process claim that might exist in criminal cases, 
that might exist in habeas cases, that might exist in 
civil cases, then the government believes that the 
statute should be read so as not to include that
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do these hypotheticals make any difference? This is an as-applied challenge
 We should look to the activities that this organization 
wants to conduct, unless -- unless you think that there 
is an overbreadth problem
 And that seems to me -- I'm not even sure that the Petitioners assert that here
 Clearly, the -- the broad scope of this statute is -- is constitutional, and whatever aspects of 
speech it may run afoul of are -- are minimal
 That being the case, of what relevance are these 
hypotheticals? It's a lot of fun, and it's very interesting, but we can deal with all of that when the 
situations arise, can't we? GENERAL KAGAN: Well, I -- I do think that the answer to that is yes, Justice Scalia
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The answer on the other  
Official side is: All we want to do is speak about lawful activities
 We™re not supplying any guns, any communication equipment
 We just want to speak about lawful activities
 And I go back to my failure to understand your line between, yes, you can communicate with these 
people, but you can't communicate about going about 
their aims through peaceful means
 GENERAL KAGAN: No, I think my line is you can communicate, but you can't provide material support
 
You can't make a donation, whether it's tangible or 
intangible
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry
 You can communicate on -- I don't mean to interrupt
 But you can communicate on your own, but you can't communicate 
with them? GENERAL KAGAN: No --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, okay
 GENERAL KAGAN: -- you can communicate with --on your own, for sure
 Independent advocacy of all kinds is not touched by this statute
 In addition to that --JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Justice Ginsburg's question is: Can you advocate peaceful means? And let's assume that if they embrace peaceful means, they get 
more interest in their organization, the organization  
Official becomes stronger for all purposes
 Can you do that? That was Justice Ginsburg's question
 GENERAL KAGAN: Can you say to an organization: Look, you guys really should lay down your arms
 And two things --JUSTICE KENNEDY: And here's how to do it
 And here's how to go to the U
N
, and here's how to 
apply for aid, and here's how to file an amicus brief
 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, now you can't, because when you tell people here's how to apply for 
aid and here's how to represent yourself within 
international organizations or within the U
S
 Congress, 
you've given them an extremely valuable skill that they 
can use for all kinds of purposes, legal or illegal
 
And it's not sufficient for the Petitioners --JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you can -- you can communicate, but the communications are censored
 That™s -- you said you can meet with -- you can be a member, you 
can attend meetings, you can discuss things, but there 
are only -- there™s a certain point at which the discussion 
must stop, right? GENERAL KAGAN: The discussion must stop when you -- when you go over the line into giving 
valuable advice, training, support to these 
organizations
 At that point -- 
Official JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a sort of basic question that I™ve had trouble with throughout the 
whole argument? We™re talking about whether this is an as-applied challenge or on its face
 And what the district judge did was hold part of the statute 
unconstitutional as being too vague: the words ﬁtrainingﬂ and ﬁadvice,ﬂ et cetera
 Why isn't that a facial decision? GENERAL KAGAN: Well, the -- both the lower courts -- I think the district court and the 
court of appeals, I think, had a kind of confused analysis 
here, which is that they said, well, it's vague as applied
 
The court of appeals specifically said it's not vague 
on its face, and there is no facial vagueness claim here, 
and yet they appeared to incorporate aspects of overbreadth 
analysis into their as-applied claim
 I think --JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless you're in an overbreadth situation, a vagueness challenge can be an 
as-applied challenge
 A statute can be vague as applied to certain conduct, although the core conduct that it 
covers is clearly covered
 GENERAL KAGAN: No, that's --JUSTICE SCALIA: We have cases like that
 GENERAL KAGAN: That's exactly right, Justice Scalia, and -- and -- and with respect to the 
Official as-applied vagueness claim, the government's position is 
there's -- there's -- there -- it's not vague, because 
you can go through these declarations, you can go 
through these complaints, and you can know exactly what's 
included within --JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but I have the same --GENERAL KAGAN: -- the statute and what's not
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I had the same question as Justice Stevens
 It's a very odd as-applied challenge because there hasn't been a prosecution
 And vagueness as applied, I think as Professor Cole can answer, is, it 
seems to me, if, you know, that it applies, it isn't vague
 
I don™t understand that, but --GENERAL KAGAN: Well, it --JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I can't -- I can't think of a case in which the Court, pre-prosecution in a 
declaratory judgment, has said that it's improper as 
applied to certain things
 Or maybe I'm wrong
 Maybe I am missing some case
 GENERAL KAGAN: No, I -- I -- I don't think you are wrong, Justice Kennedy, and especially with 
respect to a case where all the activity is -- clearly 
fits in one box or the other
 In other words, you can  
Official go through the complaints, you can go through the 
declarations, and know exactly what is covered and what's 
not covered
 All the independent --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that™s -- I'm not -- I'm not sure that's right
 I mean, expert advice or assistance -- I don't know sitting down that I could tell, 
you know, how to advocate for peaceful, you know, 
resolution or whatever
 Is that expert advice? Is that specialized knowledge? And I understand training, service, personnel, but that one's a little hard to --GENERAL KAGAN: Well, as I said, Mr
 Chief Justice, there will be some hard cases, there 
always are when it comes to applying statutes
 The question is never are there hard cases
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, my -- my point is that this --GENERAL KAGAN: The question is the indeterminacy
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes
 My point is that even knowing what they intend to do, it's kind of hard 
to decide whether that's based on specialized knowledge 
or not
 GENERAL KAGAN: I think it -- it actually is pretty clear in this case
 If you read the declarations, if you read the complaints, the expertise of these  
Official parties actually shines through
 Judge Fertig is proud of his expertise, justifiably so
 He has --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does this -- what --what these plaintiffs are seeking to do -- does it have 
any resemblance to the  prosecutions that you have 
brought under this Act? It was my understanding that those were for supplying weapons, supplying other 
equipment
 Are there any prosecutions that are -- that aim at training to pursue the organization's aims 
through peaceful means? GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Ginsburg, I think that this is not the typical case
 This is, of course, a case that might never have reached this Court, except 
that it was brought as a declaratory judgment action
 
For the most part, what the government prosecutes are 
cases which involve a wide variety of support to foreign 
terrorist organizations
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Specifically, does this particular man have to be prosecuted? GENERAL KAGAN: I'm sorry? JUSTICE STEVENS: Is this particular individual in risk of being prosecuted if he makes the 
speech to the United Nations? GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Stevens, I do believe that this individual can make whatever speeches  
Official he wants at the United Nations
 To the extent that he is acting as a representative or as an agent of the PKK, 
he does fall within the contours of the statute
 That's a different thing
 JUSTICE STEVENS: And is there evidence that he would be prosecuted if he --GENERAL KAGAN: Of course, that's a different thing as to how prosecutorial judgment is used 
to decide which are the high-priority cases and which 
are the low-priority cases
 JUSTICE STEVENS: But in essence, this is an action to enjoin a potential prosecution against 
somebody for making a potential speech? That's really what we are fighting about, I think
 GENERAL KAGAN: Again, the government did not bring this action
 Judge Fertig and the Petitioners brought this action to try to get a declaratory 
judgment
 As applied to them, the statute indeed covers their various efforts or proposed activities of 
being an agent of, of representing the PKK and the LTTE, 
that falls within the statute and I think makes the 
as-applied claim here not vague at all
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General
 Mr
 Cole, we™ll give you  minutes
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID D
 COLE  
Official ON BEHALF OF HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT, ET AL
 MR
 COLE: Thank you, Mr
 Chief Justice
 I want to start by addressing the question of strict scrutiny
 The -- the -- Justice Kennedy, you asked, and a number of the Justices asked, doesn't it 
make a difference that what they've done is prohibited a 
wide range of conduct and just some of that is speech? Well, that's precisely an accurate description of the breach of the peace statute in Cohen v
 California
 It forbade breaches of peace through loud noises, through horse racing in the streets, 
through any kind of offensive conduct
 But when California applied that statute to the words on Mr
 
Cohen's jacket and then argued because we are not 
interested in the words on his jacket, we are interested 
in preserving the peace, however it™s breached, O'Brien 
should apply, the Court said no
 We deal here with the conviction resting solely upon speech, not upon any 
separately identifiable conduct
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I agree
 And that was as applied to a conviction
 MR
 COLE: That's right
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just haven't seen an as-applied challenge on declaratory relief
 The government doesn't seem to object to that procedure
 
Official MR
 COLE: No
 Well, the government doesn't object because there are actually many cases, and FEC v
 
Wisconsin Right to Life is only the most recent
 But, again, the notion is somebody who is told you can meet 
with a group, you can discuss with a group -- in fact, 
the House report says that you are free to speak with 
and on behalf of a designated group
 But then you have a statute that says, if you advocate in any coordinated way, if you tell them 
anything that™s derived from specialized knowledge, if 
you tell them anything of specific skill, you're --
you're engaged in a crime and you could go to jail for 
 years
 That's why the Humanitarian Law Project came to me
 They said: We™ve been doing this kind of lawful activity
 We think it's our right, but we™re not going to risk going to jail for  years to do 
it
 The government has spent a decade arguing that our clients cannot advocate for peace, cannot 
inform about international human rights
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If O'Brien applies, what remains of your case? MR
 COLE: If O'Brien applies, then I think the Court would still be applying the scrutiny that 
Official asks, is there a reasonable fit -- is there a reasonable 
fit between the specific speech that's at issue here, 
speech on issues of public concern, advocating only 
lawful activity, and the -- and that the government 
legitimately seeks to further, which is stopping support 
for terrorism? Now --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That analysis of the activities that you are proposing has not been done by 
the lower courts, correct? MR
 COLE: Well, the lower courts struck --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They -- they haven't --they struck it on vagueness grounds, but none --MR
 COLE: Right
 The --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- none of the courts either subjected this to strict scrutiny or the 
reasonable fit --MR
 COLE: No, and, in fact, the government has never even attempted to defend the statute under strict 
scrutiny, because I think it clearly could not satisfy 
strict scrutiny
 And under this -- under Cohen, strict scrutiny is what must be applied here
 In addition --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why don't -- why don't we remand it to the lower courts to apply strict 
scrutiny if we agree with you that O'Brien doesn't apply  
Official here? MR
 COLE: I think it would be appropriate to remand for -- for application of strict scrutiny if 
you read it that O'Brien doesn't apply
 O'Brien also doesn't apply if the statute is not content neutral
 This is a statute that doesn't bar all aid; it doesn't even bar all speech
 It permits unlimited provision of religious materials, even if they 
advocate jihad, but proscribes any secular material, even 
if they are advocating peace
 So -- so there are -- the -- the lower court, again, found that the statute was vague, that our 
clients were reasonably chilled, that they had a right 
to engage in this activity
 I think you can reach that result either through vagueness, or you can reach it by 
applying strict scrutiny, or I think because the fit is 
so poor here, and because -- and the vagueness, in fact, 
undermines the fit, because people are chilled from 
engaging even in speech that the government doesn't want 
to prohibit
 All right, if I am told you -- you -- you™ll go to jail if you tell them anything that™s derived from 
special --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr
 Cole, there were congressional findings that money is fungible first for  
Official doesn't have jurisdiction over the ocean carrier 
receiving
 MR
 BALLENGER: That -- that's correct, Your Honor
 And then the question is --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so you are the --you have to be the person -- the railroad has to be the 
person receiving the goods, correct? MR
 BALLENGER: No, Your Honor
 The receiving carrier has always been the party at the point 
of origin of the shipment
 And you can see if you look at the venue provision in the current language --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you™re not reading the language
 Doesn't the language say the person who receives under the jurisdiction of the board? MR
 BALLENGER: No, Your Honor
 It's --it's two separate requirements
 It's always been understood as two separate requirements
 Carmack requires that the receiving -- a receiving carrier is 
subject to the jurisdiction of the board, and then it 
also has to be the receiving carrier
 The receiving carrier is the originating carrier
 If you look at the venue provision --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I keep going back to: What language tells me that particular point in the statute?  
Official MR
 BALLENGER: Because otherwise the -- the whole structure of the statute doesn't work
 Carmack draws a distinction between receiving carriers, delivering 
carriers, and connecting carriers
 If receiving property directly from another common carrier and merely moving it for a portion of the 
journey and connecting that were enough to make you a 
receiving carrier -- and, of course, it is in common 
parlance; you are receiving goods in that circumstance
 
But this receiving --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's my problem
 MR
 BALLENGER: "Receiving carrier" has always been a term of art in this statute
 If that were enough to make you a receiving carrier, then the 
statutory structure would fall apart, because every 
interim carrier in the line would be a receiving 
carrier
 Every single one of them receives property --JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but not --MR
 BALLENGER: -- property for transportation
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not every -- where you are dealing with -- with intermodal transportation, not every 
receiving -- not every rail carrier would be the receiving 
rail carrier
 I mean, this --MR
 BALLENGER: That --JUSTICE SCALIA: Your client is the first 
Official rail carrier to receive, right? MR
 BALLENGER: It's not how -- that's not how the statute is worded, Justice Scalia
 The statute --JUSTICE BREYER: Is this the language? It says the -- see if it helps with Justice Scalia's question
 The language says "a rail carrier providing transportation 
or service subject to the jurisdiction ofﬂ the STB ﬁshall 
issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it 
receives
" MR
 BALLENGER: Correct
 JUSTICE BREYER: And so that's what it has to do, is a bill of lading for property it receives
 
And you are saying "receives" means receives from the 
shipper
 MR
 BALLENGER: It has always meant --JUSTICE BREYER: It does not mean receives from another carrier
 MR
 BALLENGER: It has always meant that
 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? MR
 BALLENGER: That's correct, Your Honor
 It has always meant that
 It has to mean that, because otherwise, if you read it to mean receives from another 
carrier, then every single connecting carrier or delivering 
carrier in the chain would be a receiving carrier as  
Official well as a connecting or delivering carrier and required 
to issue its own bill of lading, which would turn the 
historic purposes of Carmack on its head
 The purpose of Carmack was to require the first carrier in the chain to issue a single through 
bill of lading to the destination that would govern the 
whole voyage under uniform, consistent liability terms
 
No one else in the chain is supposed to issue a bill of 
lading, so there™s only one receiving carrier
 It's the first carrier who deals directly with the shipper
 
If you look at the venue provision, you can see that the 
statute uses the term "originating carrier" 
interchangeably with "receiving carrier," and it 
provides venue over that carrier only at the point of 
origin of the shipment
 That would make absolutely no sense if someone downstream could be the receiving 
carrier
 In this circumstance you would say, I suppose, that Union Pacific was the receiving carrier --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I always thought that the purpose of Carmack was to ensure rail 
responsibility, rail carrier responsibility, so that it 
was one bill of lading with respect to all railroad 
connections
 If that was the purpose of Carmack --MR
 BALLENGER: That's not quite correct, Your Honor
  
Official JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay
 MR
 BALLENGER: Historically, this Court explained in Atlantic Coast Line v
 Riverside Mills and in the Ward case, the purpose of Carmack was to require through 
transportation, a through bill of lading, from the 
originating point to the destination point, a single 
bill of lading under consistent terms, so that the 
shipper does not have to prove where damage occurred
 The point of Carmack --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But on the rail line
 MR
 BALLENGER: On --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: On rail -- on the rail transportation
 MR
 BALLENGER: On any transportation, actually, Your Honor
 The way that the statute works, it can --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Historically you say that? MR
 BALLENGER: Yes, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the pre- Carmack, there is a -- if you want to take a look at it
 MR
 BALLENGER: Sure
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It is in page a of your petition
 It reads: "If the loss, damage, or injury occurs while the property is in the custody of 
Official a carrier by water, that liability" -- "the 
liability of such carrier shall be determined by the 
bill of lading of the carrier by water and by and under 
the laws applicable to transportation by water
" MR
 BALLENGER: Yes, Your Honor
 That --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So --MR
 BALLENGER: That provision was introduced in the Transportation Act of 
 It's talking about domestic water carriers
 And it's still there in the statute
 It's just in the -- the Carmack provision -- when Congress split Carmack into three in 
, it moved that provision to (c)()
 And --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So explain to me what happens in domestic water cases
 It says that you can have a different bill of lading for the water transport
 
That bill of lading controls your damage on the water, 
and it separates that out from damage on the rail side? MR
 BALLENGER: In domestic -- Congress drew a distinction between foreign and domestic commerce for 
a very long time, Your Honor
 In domestic commerce, the rule has been that a rail carrier could interconnect 
with a domestic water carrier and the domestic water 
carrier could carry it for a leg of the trip, and the 
whole trip would still be governed by the Carmack 
through bill of lading
 But if there was damage during  
Official the water portion, it would be governed by the water 
law, which is the Harter Act
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And the railroad is covered by any damage that occurs on land? MR
 BALLENGER: The railroad is liable on a through transportation basis for the entire trip, but if 
the damage occurred during the water leg, its liability 
is limited and confined by the law that governs the 
water leg
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there already is domestically two different forms of liability 
protection? MR
 BALLENGER: Congress made that compromise, because Congress was forced to choose 
between not having through bills of lading at all 
domestically or making -- or essentially repealing the 
Harter Act in circumstances where rail carriers interact 
with them
 Congress made the choice to compromise and have kind of a hybrid arrangement
 But in foreign trade -- the geographics of Carmack was always confined -- that Carmack did not apply 
to imports at all, and it did not apply to exports except 
for exports to adjacent foreign countries --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Prior -- prior to 
 If I think you lose on that question under the law  
Official as happens to be currently codified, but would prevail 
under the pre- law, what -- what is your strongest 
case for the proposition that what I referred to earlier 
as the boilerplate language trumps the plain language of 
the currently codified version? MR
 BALLENGER: Your Honor, we don't think that this Court has ever interpreted language of that 
nature
 But in a different context with a much weaker statutory language, the Fourco Glass line of cases, this 
Court applies a strong thumb on the scale that Congress 
didn't intend to change the law
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of a difficult -- I mean, if you™re a shipper and you™re 
trying to figure out, okay, let's ship some goods, and 
you pick up the law and it says, well, this is what the 
law says, who's going to tell you that, well, that you 
may think that's what the law says, but you™re really 
governed by the pre- law
 MR
 BALLENGER: Well, Your Honor, we don't -- we don™t think that it™s -- it is necessary for this 
Court to read the statute in a counter-textual way
 
You just have to do what this Court has always done and 
read the statute as a whole, including giving some weight 
to that provision, which is in the text of the statute, and 
reading the rest of the statute in light of it
  
Official And I think if you do that, particularly in this case, it's really not that hard to reconcile the 
pre- law with the current law
 Union Pacific can™t be a receiving carrier because it didn't receive the 
goods at the point of origin
 "K" Line isn't a rail carrier
 That's enough to resolve this case, and this Court doesn't need to go any farther
 Actually, that would, as a practical matter, mostly resolve the 
commercial problem that this Court granted certiorari to 
resolve
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one question
 I know that it™s -- your white light is on
 Can I assume that whether we rule for Petitioners or Respondents in 
this case, the shipping world, the cargo world, will 
immediately adjust to our decision? It's not going to be a problem
 There are insurers, there are freight forwarders, there are form contracts
 People will know exactly what to do
 They will adjust in  week to what we do
 Am I right about that? Or can you say that if we adopt the Respondents™ position, it will be disruptive to 
the shipping trade and so forth? MR
 BALLENGER: Not exactly, Your Honor, because of course Respondents™ position is that Carmack 
is a mandatory regime; there™s no way to contract 
around it if it applies
 So Respondents™ position is 
Official that Carmack mandatorily must govern the inland leg of 
any of these through shipments
 The practical consequence of that is that true through bills of 
lading -- unity of responsibility in one shipper under 
consistent terms for the entire voyage -- will become 
impossible in foreign trade
 So there won't be a way to correct that
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr
 Ballenger
 Mr
 Yang
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS MR
 YANG: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I™d like to address a few of the questions that have come up already
 Justice Sotomayor, you asked what Supreme Court decision addresses the 
receiving carrier
 There™s a series of decisions which address receiving carriers and the nature of the 
receiving carrier as the initial carrier that receives 
goods from the shipper
 I would -- Mexican Light and Power Company, , is probably the best, but that 
traces its way back all the way to the s, Galveston 
Wharf Company, Ward, Starbird, Blish Milling, Riverside  
Official Mills
 These cases are largely cited at our brief at page  to , footnote 
 Regarding the geographic scope of Carmack on the current text, we believe that the current text, 
which is reproduced in the petition appendix at a --
if you look at the combination of both the first and the 
third sentences of Carmack, we believe that that 
reproduces the historic scope as encompassing only 
domestic transportation, purely domestic transportation, 
and transportation to an adjacent foreign country when 
it's an export
 The first sentence requires that the rail carrier be providing transportation or service subject 
to the jurisdiction of the board and issue a receipt or 
bill of lading
 The very purpose of Carmack from the very beginning, its core purpose, was to allow a shipper 
to sue the initial carrier
 The initial carrier was responsible for the entire shipment
 All the connecting carriers were deemed to be agents of the initial carrier, 
and, therefore, there was an easy defendant for the 
shipper, who dealt directly with that shipper -- that 
carrier and received a bill of lading from that carrier 
to sue
 That --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I read -- I read your brief, like your friend's, as relying almost  
Official exclusively on the pre- language
 MR
 YANG: Our brief addressed the first sentence briefly in, I believe, the prior page
 Page  to  deals with the first sentence, and then  deals 
with the third
 But our point is that the first sentence sets an anchor in the United States as the -- as the 
origin of the shipment
 Part A jurisdiction -- this is reproduced at page a of the petition appendix
 It does cover shipments that themselves transit United States and 
foreign countries
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me
 What -- what are you referring to now? MR
 YANG: a of the petition appendix
 This is section , which defines Part A jurisdiction 
of the STB
 And then I'm looking --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Union Pacific petition appendix? MR
 YANG: They™re both -- both of them are actually the same
 Both the petition appendices are the same
 So I'm looking down at -- (a)() provides that the jurisdiction of the STB applies only to 
transportation into the United States when that's 
between -- you know, part of a larger transit between  
Official the U
S
 and a foreign country or even purely 
domestically
 So, a shipper -- or a carrier that is subject to STB jurisdiction has to be providing this U
S
 transportation when it issues the bill of lading
 So the -- again, the central purpose was to provide a 
carrier by which -- against whom the shipper can bring 
suit in a convenient forum, the person that the shipper 
dealt with
 And that's now reflected in section -- the forum provision of Carmack, which is subsection (d)(), 
it provides that a suit under Carmack may only be 
brought against the originating rail carrier in the 
judicial district in which the point of origin is 
located
 Those -- and the prior provision says that that's a U
S
 district court or a State court
 Carmack itself anchors the transportation as starting in the United States
 And then the third sentence explains the remainder of the historic scope
 The third sentence --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- we™re looking where, now? MR
 YANG: This is back to (a)
 It™s Carmack, third sentence in subsection (b)
 It defines the liability under Carmack
 It says the liability under this section is for damage ﬁcaused by the receiving  
Official carrier, the delivering carrier, or another rail carrier 
over whose line or route the property is transited in 
the United States or from a place in the United States 
to a place in an adjacent foreign country
ﬂ So, what that does is that provides the center for the two bookends
 The first bookend is the originating carrier, the receiving carrier that receives 
the goods in the United States, provides the bill of 
lading to the shipper
 The second bookend is the delivering carrier, and in between -- remember Carmack was intended 
to cover the entire carriage as a unified whole
 The in-between is transportation in the United States or 
export transportation from the United States to a point 
in a foreign country
 We believe that that text, read as a whole, reflects the historic scope of Carmack that's existed 
since  when it was extended beyond purely domestic 
transportation
 JUSTICE SCALIA: But why -- why doesn't the (), (a)(), the delivering rail carrier -- if what you 
say is true, that should be the delivering rail carrier 
delivering in a -- in an adjacent foreign country
 MR
 YANG: Correct
 JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that limitation is  
Official strangely missing from ()
 MR
 YANG: Well, we believe the portion of (a)(), which now looks like it's in (a)(), the ﬁover 
whose line or route the property isﬂ transited --
ﬁtransportedﬂ actually applies to the receiving and 
delivering rail carrier
 If you would turn to page a and a of the reply brief of Union Pacific, there™s a side-by-side 
comparison
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay
 Wait a minute now
 MR
 YANG: I'm sorry to have the --JUSTICE SCALIA: The paragraphing you say is wrong? MR
 YANG: The -- from a to a, you™ll see a is the  version of Carmack that was enacted in the 
 codification
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right
 MR
 YANG: The current version is reflected on the facing page
 There was no paragraph indentation in 
 And in , when Congress changed the text, it did include a paragraph indentation, but the committee 
report -- the conference report is very clear that 
Carmack was not changed
 Also --JUSTICE SCALIA: So all -- you™re saying that -- I think what you™re saying is that all we have  
Official to use the statutory statement that nothing was meant 
to be changed or is to say, well, that paragraphing in 
 is just wrong, right? MR
 YANG: Well, I don't know -- you mean the indentation? JUSTICE SCALIA: The indentation
 MR
 YANG: The indentation was inadvertent
 And I would actually direct the Court to page a, which 
is the other part of Carmack that now exists for motor 
transportation and freight forwarders
 There is no indentation
 The current version of the other half of Carmack does not provide the indentation
 The indentation is inadvertent
 And in ' -- the ' Act, which --JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm losing you
 a? MR
 YANG: a -- (a)() reproduces what we were just looking for -- looking at in the rail carrier 
context
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay
 MR
 YANG: It's a single paragraph
 That's the way it's existed since, you know, , basically, 
or  when they added receiving carriers
 So, what the Court can do -- it's true, Carmack is less clear than it used to be
 It was made somewhat less clear in ' and in '
 But we believe  
Official that when you take the text as a whole, particularly 
when read in light of the context of this Court's 
decision and the long-standing practice in the United States 
reflected in the STB -- the STB's decisions, that is the 
ICC's decisions, the predecessor, that at least the 
provision is ambiguous
 And if the provision is ambiguous, section (a), the mandate that the statute should not be construed 
to make a substantive change in the law, should control
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This may not have anything to do with anything
 Is there a reason the STB doesn't appear on your brief? MR
 YANG: The STB does not appear on our brief --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It did in the Kirby case just a few years ago
 MR
 YANG: It did
 It did
 The STB has not taken a position about the current scope of Carmack and, 
therefore, decided not to join our brief
 JUSTICE BREYER: Is -- is there a way to --are you finished? MR
 YANG: No
 I would say, though, that the ICC's decisions remain binding
 This is 
 The statute, ICCTA section (a), which is a note now to 
section  of Title , specifically provided that the  
Official ICC's orders and determinations would remain binding 
unless changed by the STB
 The STB just did not, at this point, come on record and take a position about the 
scope of Carmack
 JUSTICE BREYER: We don't even get into this problem if -- unless the ship line is a rail carrier? MR
 YANG: In part
 There's -- if you --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it says, ﬁA rail carrier providing transportation or service subject toﬂ 
the STB ﬁshall issue a receipt or a bill of lading
ﬂ 
That's what leads us into the problem
 MR
 YANG: That would take care of the initial carrier, what we believe is the initial 
receiving carrier in the case, "K" Line
 However, I believe the argument is being made that Carmack could 
suddenly apply mid-carriage at the border
 JUSTICE BREYER: But mid-carriage -- it only talks about -- they use that word "received
" That's why I thought possibly it didn't because it says --MR
 YANG: I believe the argument is that the first carrier who receives property in the United 
States would be deemed the receiving carrier
 JUSTICE BREYER: That's a separate argument? MR
 YANG: That's a separate argument
 JUSTICE BREYER: Did the Ninth Circuit pass  
Official on that argument? MR
 YANG: You would have -- excuse me
 JUSTICE BREYER: Did the Ninth Circuit pass on that argument? MR
 YANG: It did not
 JUSTICE BREYER: It did not
 MR
 YANG: It did not
 JUSTICE BREYER: So that's not right in front of us? MR
 YANG: That is correct
 JUSTICE BREYER: It's quite different
 MR
 YANG: It is a different -- but we think it's clearly wrong in light of Carmack's historic 
purpose
 This would be to divide the -- the -- if that were correct, it would divide the transportation in two
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 MR
 YANG: Thank you
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr
 Frederick
 Mr
 Frederick
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C
 FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS MR
 FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It does not take great mental gymnastics to read the plain language of this statute and resolve it  
Official the way the Ninth Circuit did in favor of Respondents
 The case is controlled by the plain language of several Federal statutes, and they have been adverted 
to, to some extent
 But I would like to point out to the Court that in -/ pages of our merits brief, 
starting at page  and going over to page , we not 
only cite the full language in full of the Carmack 
Amendment and the jurisdictional provision of the STB, 
but explain how Union Pacific is a delivering carrier 
within the meaning of the Carmack Amendment; under the 
plain terms of the statute, they are liable for the 
loss; the Carmack Amendment applies to their receipt of 
the property; and the train derailment which was caused 
by their negligence comes within the plain terms of the 
Carmack Amendment
 JUSTICE BREYER: Then under that view, I guess that -- that any intermodal transport, China, all 
the goods coming from China, which tend to move under a 
single bill of lading, as soon as they get to the United 
States and go on a train for  miles, a new bill of 
lading must issue? MR
 FREDERICK: No
 In fact, this Carmack Amendment --JUSTICE BREYER: Why? MR
 FREDERICK: -- explicitly says, quote:  
Official "Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not 
affect the liability of a rail carrier
" Carmack --JUSTICE BREYER: All right, so you're saying they don't have to issue --MR
 FREDERICK: They do not have to issue a separate --JUSTICE BREYER: Fine
 If they don't have to issue a separate receipt, what we™re talking about 
is the bill of lading that was issued by the ship
 MR
 FREDERICK: That's correct
 JUSTICE BREYER: All right
 Now, if that's correct and if the ship -- the only one that has to do 
that, it says, is a rail carrier, and a rail carrier is 
a person providing common carrier rail transport
 And then that's defined to include intermodal equipment used 
by or in connection with a railroad
 And my understanding -- which I'm asking you for correction 
if I don™t -- is that the argument here is the ship is 
providing intermodal equipment used by or in connection 
with a railroad
 MR
 FREDERICK: That's correct
 JUSTICE BREYER: And it's the words "used by or in connection with" that I am focusing on, because to 
apply those words here seems to me to bring every 
international shipment in the world, no matter how small  
Official the American portion by rail and no matter how big the 
foreign part of this transport -- it brings it all within 
Carmack
 And it means that the bill of ladings issued by people throughout the world are all going to have to 
apply to meet the terms of the Carmack Amendment, which 
had the purposes of railroads in the United States, and 
that's going to be a nightmare
 MR
 FREDERICK: No, it won't, Justice Breyer
 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, first, is it true what I said? And, second, if it is true why isn't it way contrary to the purpose and a nightmare? MR
 FREDERICK: It is not -- it is true and not true, but for different reasons
 And if I could take a moment to explain, because I think it is 
important
 In , the plain language of the statute defined what the STB's jurisdiction is
 They do not dispute that the last part of the jurisdictional 
provision is the STB jurisdiction when a -- a shipment 
is in, quote, "between the United States and a place in 
a foreign country," but the STB only has jurisdiction to 
the extent the transportation occurs in the United 
States
 So it is true that imports into the United  
Official States are covered by the Carmack Amendment, but only to 
the extent of the transportation being within the United 
States
 JUSTICE BREYER: No, but why don't they have to issue a bill of lading? That's what they say
 So every company, the Finnish company, Chinese, every company, 
every shipowner, even if he™s never been to the 
United States -- sad for him, but nonetheless -- every 
one of those is going to have to issue a bill of 
lading, whatever meeting whatever requirements are 
there, and we know at least one requirement you think 
applies
 MR
 FREDERICK: Let me go back -- let me go back to the international point, Justice Breyer, because 
the railroads argued against an international uniform 
rule that would apply both to ocean carriage and inland 
carriage in the Rotterdam rules
 And they made the representation to the international community: You don't need to have a uniform rule that applies to both ocean 
carriage and inland carriage, because we have this thing 
called the Carmack Amendment
 And they made the representation that the Carmack Amendment would apply to imports, as this Court, 
in the Woodbury case written by Justice Brandeis, decided 
in , and a month earlier -- 
Official JUSTICE SCALIA: What are you arguing, estoppel? MR
 FREDERICK: No, I'm arguing that their position is inconsistent with their representations, and, 
therefore, the plain language of the statute --JUSTICE SCALIA: Which one is right? That's what we are concerned about
 MR
 FREDERICK: What I'm --JUSTICE SCALIA: Which one is right? Their earlier position or their current position? MR
 FREDERICK: Their earlier -- their earlier position was correct under the plain 
language of --JUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't you speak to that rather than the fact that they had an earlier position? MR
 FREDERICK: The plain language, Justice Scalia, as it is currently enforced, I think 
disposes of the case without any real argument
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me
 Can I go back to Justice Breyer's question? MR
 FREDERICK: Yes
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And perhaps -- as I understand this, I think we are all forgetting that none 
of these liability provisions come into play until there 
is proof that an incident has occurred somewhere, either 
Official on a railroad or on the ocean, correct? MR
 FREDERICK: Correct
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so the issue becomes which set of rules governs that particular incident --MR
 FREDERICK: Correct
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- where it happened
 MR
 FREDERICK: Correct
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think Justice Breyer asked you why it made sense that there would be two 
rules in effect for what happens on the ocean and what 
happens on land; and if we had it, wouldn't it create 
great difficulty? I think -- you may correct me
 JUSTICE BREYER: Your point was --MR
 FREDERICK: That's how the whole world --JUSTICE BREYER: -- if it creates such difficulty, why were the railroads in favor of it 
before? MR
 FREDERICK: Correct
 And that's how --that's how Europe operates
 Europe has separate conventions for rail and road that apply to damage that 
occur on land, and the European nations have acceded to 
the various versions of Hague rules --JUSTICE BREYER: Anything here that says on land? Anything in Carmack that says on land? MR
 FREDERICK: Well, it's transport -- 
Official JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, if it's in a ferry boat -- remember, we have a very broad definition 
of "rail" where "rail" includes all things that have 
nothing to do with rail
 MR
 FREDERICK: But as --JUSTICE BREYER: And so now we™ve got that broad definition, and I would have thought we traced 
through what has to be in the receipt, and then we get to 
the -- that section and where it's exempt, because they got 
-- want to get rid of it; then you have to put in -- you 
have to put in a certain kind of waiver, which is very hard 
to achieve
 And that -- that's my understanding of it
 MR
 FREDERICK: It's the Surface Transportation Board, Justice Breyer, that has the 
jurisdiction here
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but they can't get rid of the thing you like
 MR
 FREDERICK: No, they can
 JUSTICE BREYER: They can? MR
 FREDERICK: They can
 JUSTICE BREYER: How do they do it? MR
 FREDERICK: And I want to get to Justice Kennedy's question
 They can
 These are background rules that we™re talking about, and they will 
be contracted around
 After the Sompo decision was 
Official decided in the Second Circuit, Union Pacific went right 
out and changed the contracts that they have with ocean 
carriers to ensure that the ocean carriers would 
indemnify them if they were liable and did not get the 
full benefits of contractual extensions
 What we're talking about here --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you don™t --MR
 FREDERICK: -- is whether there's an American forum for American cargo interests for an 
American train that is derailed in the United States
 
That's what we are talking about
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But part of your argument -- you don't rely heavily on your plain 
language argument when it comes to deciding that these 
huge ocean vessels are rail carriers
 MR
 FREDERICK: Let me go to that point now, Mr
 Chief Justice
 The Port of Long Beach is situated more than  miles from Los Angeles, and the port has 
 miles of train track with intermodal, multimodal 
facilities that get the cargo containers which "K" Line 
owns on chassis that "K" Line owns, and they have to get 
from the Port of Long Beach  miles away to the Los 
Angeles train depot where Union Pacific picks them up
 Now, under "K" Line's theory of the case, they get to have a donut hole in the Carmack Amendment  
Official liability provision for that -mile transport
 We would submit as a factual matter, which of course would 
need to be done on remand, that there are facts that can 
be adduced to establish the functionality test which the 
ICC has long administered to look at the functions being 
performed as well as --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's a little bit different from your argument that they are a rail 
carrier because their bill of lading would cover the 
train ride to Chicago
 MR
 FREDERICK: We didn't make that argument
 Our argument was that, based on the functions and them holding themselves out to be a rail carrier, 
which they have done, they qualify under the normal ICC 
method of determining rail carrier
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it weren't -- if it weren't for the -- for the track from Long Beach to 
Los Angeles, you would say then they™re not a rail 
carrier? MR
 FREDERICK: The argument, as the ICC has defined it, also looks at things like the multimodal 
facilities, like the containers, and -- and the holding 
themselves out as a rail carrier in their advertising
 
Those are important parts of the functionality test
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how -- how does  
Official the Chief Justice's hypothetical work with the language 
of the statute? They -- it just goes to Los Angeles and it -- there™s a railroad track right by -- by the 
wharf, and it's the Union Pacific Railroad
 MR
 FREDERICK: Well, there are -- there are two ways to read the text and resolve the case
 One is to say "K" Line is the receiving rail carrier when it 
transfers from the international ocean carriage 
corporation to the American multimodal transportation 
operation and gets the goods from the Port of Long Beach 
up to Los Angeles, and then treat UP, Union Pacific, as 
the delivering rail carrier
 Under the statute, UP is not required -- although the first part says you™re 
supposed to issue a bill of lading, their liability for 
the train derailment does not turn on whether they 
issued a bill of lading or not
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is your case -- does your case end if we hold that "K" Line is not a railroad 
carrier? MR
 FREDERICK: No
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right
 MR
 FREDERICK: "K" Line gets out of the case
 We would have to go to Tokyo to pursue "K" Line under the bill of lading
 But we could continue our suit against Union Pacific as a delivering rail carrier  
Official under the Carmack Amendment
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As a delivering carrier
 MR
 FREDERICK: Correct
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, unless we hold, as your friends argue on the other side, that they 
can opt out under 
 MR
 FREDERICK: Well, you would need to reach the question of whether or not exempt carriage 
under  takes away the option of a  contract
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's a different question with respect to liability and claims 
and with respect to venue
 MR
 FREDERICK: Correct
 And let me address that, if I might
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I just -- just briefly before you answer the Judge --MR
 FREDERICK: Sure
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Justice -- the Chief
 In what capacity -- "K" Line is the contracting party with 
Union Pacific
 Under what contract could the shipper sue Union Pacific? MR
 FREDERICK: Under the --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If "K" Line is -- is the shipper --MR
 FREDERICK: Directly under the Carmack 
Official Amendment
 And in fact, when Union Pacific removed this case from State court to Federal court, the Federal 
question was they said: There is a Carmack Amendment claim being asserted against us
 That's how we get from State court to Federal court
 And when they -- when they sought to transfer the case from California to New York, they did so on the 
basis of the convenience of  of the  witnesses to their 
train derailment being American citizens
 So it's not like there needs to be some special -- there™s a special cause of action within the 
Carmack Amendment, Justice Sotomayor, that provides a 
means of redress for damaged cargo interests to go 
directly against the railroad
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Perhaps --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Regardless of whether the shipment was by them directly or not? MR
 FREDERICK: Correct, if they caused the damage
 That's the whole point of the Carmack Amendment
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe now you could respond to my question about the distinction under  
between claims and liability and venue
 MR
 FREDERICK: Yes
 The STB, in an authoritative determination that is entitled to our  
Official deference, has said that when it issues an exemption for 
certain categories of rail carriage, which it has done 
with the multimodal shipments, those exemptions remove 
the possibility of a  contract carriage
 And the reason for that is that, in both situations, the rail carrier has to provide an 
opportunity for Carmack-compliant terms to be given to 
the shipper
 If it's exempt cargo carriage under , (e) says that the carrier must provide 
Carmack-compliant terms in order to take advantage of 
the exemption and contract under the exemption
  provides contract carriage, but only if the rail carrier 
provides common carrier tariffs that a cargo interest 
could ship under
 Here, because the transportation is exempt under  -- , there is no common carrier tariff 
that is applicable
 And that's why the STB has said if there™s no common carrier tariff applicable under 
, then there cannot be an opportunity for contract 
carriage
 To do otherwise would be to make the statute a complete deregulation statute
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's a little -- I mean, the -- I™m looking at page a of the 
petition appendix, where they™re saying you can't exempt 
through contractual terms for liability and claims
  
Official Venue is treated elsewhere, separately from liability and 
claims
 So, again, under -- you™re the plain language team, and that seems fairly plain that venue is not covered
 MR
 FREDERICK: No -- well, liability, Your Honor, is where you can bring your suit and what your 
suit --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, the liability is not where you can bring your suit
 Liability is liability
 Venue is where you can bring your suit
 MR
 FREDERICK: The -- the way the board has construed this in the letter brief that they filed in 
the -- in the Second Circuit, which is entitled to our 
deference, says the Ninth Circuit in Regal-Beloit got it 
right with respect to the interplay between , 
, and -- and contract carriage
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait
 Excuse me
 You say we have to defer to a letter --MR
 FREDERICK: No --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- brief in another case? I think most of my colleagues would not defer to a 
letter brief in this case
 And you™re saying that we owe deference to a letter brief in another case? MR
 FREDERICK: That is what this Court held --JUSTICE SCALIA: Mead, which I didn't agree  
Official with, it seems to me --MR
 FREDERICK: Mead did not overrule Auer, and in Auer the Court -- this Court gave deference to a 
brief by the Federal Government that was setting forth 
the authoritative --JUSTICE SCALIA: In another case? MR
 FREDERICK: In that case
 JUSTICE SCALIA: In that case
 MR
 FREDERICK: But I don't know why --JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have a brief here? MR
 FREDERICK: It's a distinction without a difference, because here the Second Circuit invited 
the views of the STB to tell us what do you think is 
the interplay between these various provisions? JUSTICE SCALIA: Right
 MR
 FREDERICK: And the STB gave an authoritative view to the Second Circuit so that it could 
resolve a case in which the STB was not a party
 JUSTICE BREYER: There are two things here I don't understand I'm just trying to get clear
 In the first part, (a), it talks about -- in the definition 
of "rail carrier" -- (), I guess
 It says railroad includes -- railroad transport will include intermodal 
-- intermodal equipment transport used in connection 
with a railroad
  
Official What is intermodal equipment? MR
 FREDERICK: Those are the chassis
 They are the containers that are used to --JUSTICE BREYER: Okay
 So now, if we read it literally, to go back to my -- I'm trying to produce 
the worst example that frightens me the most
 There is  miles of railroad transport in the United States, 
but it carries the chassis, or it carries that big box, 
which has come all over the world, from all over the 
world
 And if we read this with no limitation, this definition makes the ships that carried it from other 
places railroads, and once that's railroad 
transportation, we™re into Carmack
 And now, if STB exempts it, what happens is the provision comes into play that says you can't exempt 
an exempt carrier, in effect, from the liability 
provisions
 And it means the ships that had to issue the bill of lading now have to allow the kinds of suits --
now, here is the point I'm not certain about -- I would 
think against them, not just against a railroad carrier, 
and perhaps against them for anything that happens, even 
on the ocean, and not just the railroad carrier for 
something that happens within the United States
 MR
 FREDERICK: No
 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, explain to me: What 
Official is it that gets us out of that? MR
 FREDERICK: There -- the -- COGSA applies tackle to tackle
 If the damage is occurring on a ship --JUSTICE BREYER: Yes
 MR
 FREDERICK: -- the STB has no jurisdiction over that
 Carmack does not apply
 It is only once the ship --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, where does it say that? Because I™d better read that one
 MR
 FREDERICK: Well, COGSA itself, which is set out in the --JUSTICE BREYER: Yes
 Yes
 Where? MR
 FREDERICK: And under no condition --JUSTICE BREYER: Do you know -- do you know offhand where it says that, just so I -- I™d better --MR
 FREDERICK: Yes
 I can give -- the provision of COGSA that you are looking for is the 
definition of "carriage," which is set forth in --JUSTICE BREYER: Good
 MR
 FREDERICK: -- page a of the petition appendix, and it is (e)
 ﬁThe term ‚carriage of goods™ covers the period from the time when the goods are 
loaded on to the time when they are discharged from the 
ship
ﬂ And as the Court in Kirby said -- 
Official JUSTICE BREYER: That's COGSA
 That's not Carmack
 MR
 FREDERICK: Right
 JUSTICE BREYER: So what gets us out of Carmack? MR
 FREDERICK: Carmack only applies if it is carriage and transportation within the STB's 
jurisdiction
 The STB has no jurisdiction over COGSA carriers
 That's the Federal Maritime Commission
 JUSTICE BREYER: Then why are we suing --why are we suing -- why does the ship being sued here? MR
 FREDERICK: The ship is performing two different functions, Justice Breyer
 JUSTICE BREYER: I see
 MR
 FREDERICK: It is performing an ocean carriage function, and then once it™s on land -- and 
there are thousands of "K" Line containers all over the 
United States right now where "K" Line is performing 
services, motor carriage and rail carriage services, here 
in the United States
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that because they have contracted for them? MR
 FREDERICK: They own them
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they don't own Union Pacific's rail line
 
Official MR
 FREDERICK: No, they own the containers that Union Pacific is pulling
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if I -- if I own a container being pulled by somebody else's train, I'm 
in the train business? MR
 FREDERICK: Under the definition of functionality, where that is part of how the STB 
regulates
 And to say otherwise, Mr
 Chief Justice, would be to deny the Federal Government the regulatory 
authority over containers that come into this country 
representing approximately  percent of the trade
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it wouldn't
 It would just -- it may just mean that they don't have 
the regulatory authority because that container is a 
rail carrier
 MR
 FREDERICK: It™s carrying --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What™s carrying it is the rail carrier
 It's a container
 MR
 FREDERICK: But they -- well, at one level, Mr
 Chief Justice, it's sort of academic, because 
the STB exempted from Part A, which includes the Carmack 
Amendment, those containers, and it did so in an 
exemption order which we™ve cited in our -- in our brief
 
So, at some level, there™s an academic quality to this 
colloquy
 
Official JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I am a little bit confused now
 Now, back to being confused
 You™re suggesting that from the landing --it's an ocean carrier -- and the minute that the 
containers are unloaded from the vessel and put on land, 
it becomes a railroad carrier, even though its delivery 
contract may have ended at that point? MR
 FREDERICK: If its delivery contract ended at that point, it did not hold itself out --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No
 Right
 So what about --MR
 FREDERICK: -- as a rail carrier --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what about -- what is it that you're arguing makes them a railroad carrier 
once they put it there
 Let's assume the reverse of the hypothetical that you -- that you posited
 They deliver to the dock, and Union Pacific is the one that owns 
those  to  miles of connection to its main railroad
 
It's the one who™s going to provide the motor carriage
 
It's the one who™s going to take it from the -- the dock 
and bring it in
 MR
 FREDERICK: And can I just add to the hypothetical the fact, which is an important fact: Did the ocean carrier hold itself out to the public as a rail 
carrier in making the contract with the original 
shipper? Because that is an important fact that does 
Official not help us resolve your particular hypothetical, 
Justice Sotomayor
 If UP is picking up the goods with its equipment, the ocean carrier is not a rail carrier under 
our theory of the case
 There has to be functions being performed that are multimodal functions, and the ocean 
carrier has to hold --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's not merely that it has possession of the container that it has dropped 
somewhere
 It has to transport it in some way in relationship to the railroad? MR
 FREDERICK: I think that's the best way to understand the statute
 JUSTICE BREYER: Can we go back one more second? Can you just give me the citation in Carmack --not COGSA, but Carmack -- that would get our intermodal 
shipment out of the board's jurisdiction? Because what I'm thinking about is the intermodal shipment and the boat sinks near Hawaii
 
Okay? Now, on your reading of Carmack, not COGSA, what gets that shipment sunk in Hawaii -- or Midway or Guam 
or someplace -- what gets them out of Carmack? MR
 FREDERICK: Well, the --JUSTICE BREYER: Which words? MR
 FREDERICK: On a -- 
Official JUSTICE BREYER: Yes
 MR
 FREDERICK: -- the petition appendix defines the general jurisdiction
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and it includes transport, just as you defined it, between the United 
States and another place -- United States and a place 
in a foreign country
 MR
 FREDERICK: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: So that's what this is
 This is a shipment between Shanghai and San Francisco 
or Oakland
 MR
 FREDERICK: And at (a)() -- will you look at (a)(), please? JUSTICE BREYER: (a)()
 MR
 FREDERICK: (a)() says jurisdiction under paragraph  applies only to transportation in the United 
States
 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, sorry
 Between a place in -- oh, transportation in the United States
 MR
 FREDERICK: In the United States
 JUSTICE BREYER: Between a place in
 MR
 FREDERICK: Exactly
 JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you
 MR
 FREDERICK: Yes, thank you
 (Laughter
) 
Official MR
 FREDERICK: Now, it is not true that the law was settled prior to 
 The Woodbury case applied the Carmack Amendment to imports
 Union Pacific v
 Burke applied it to imports
 And in those cases, this Court made the determination that the words 
"from" and "to" were also meaning "between
" And Congress, when it cleaned up the statute in  and 
provided words that are very easy to understand now, was 
not changing what had been a well-settled practice of 
goods that were getting -- arriving at a port in the 
United States and then being transported by land means
 And it's important to understand the context in which this arose, because I think our fundamental 
disagreement with the Solicitor General's presentation 
is that it ignores the container revolution that was 
occurring between the late s and the 's, when 
this Act was codified and cleaned up
 And in that container revolution, prior to the time when containers 
were used for multimodal transportation, it was common 
for goods to be repackaged at ports in the United 
States
 They were taken off ships; they were repackaged, put onto trains or trucks, and that required 
a separate contractual arrangement
 Now, this Court, in Woodbury and Burke, had said it is not so important whether or not there is a 
Official separate contract, so long as the function and the intent 
is clear that it is being moved by rail or road in the 
United States
 The Carmack Amendment will apply, Justice Sotomayor
 You are completely correct that the purpose of the Carmack Amendment was to hold railroads and motor 
carriers responsible for the liabilities caused by their 
loss
 But when Congress then cleaned that up and put it in section , it was not intending to obviate the clear and 
unambiguous language of the statute
 It was simply providing, you know, some boilerplate that I think is 
very difficult to cause the Court to override the 
plain language of the statute today
 And in , when Congress eliminated --terminated the ICC and enacted the ICC Termination Act, 
it reenacted that language
 It did not encompass section  at that time, so the statute as it presently 
exists does not have a statutory pointer as to how you 
are to interpret the language
 And under the normal canons that this Court has instructed for courts and the 
bar, the easiest way to practice law in this area is to 
look at the statute, see what it says, and not have to 
go back, not just through the last iteration of the 
statute, but the one before that, and not just to be 
able to look at what was in the U
S
 Code, but to have  
Official to go back to the Statutes at Large to see what other 
statutory provisions Congress had put into the statute
 
That would make the practice of law extremely difficult
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you a question about -- about whether -- whether the shipper becomes a 
rail carrier? Suppose it's not  to  miles
 Suppose the -- suppose the American rail carrier is 
waiting right at the foot of the wharf, and all these 
wharves have rails that go out to the ship, okay? 
And let's assume that that's owned by the -- by the 
shipping company
 And a crane takes the -- the goods off of the ship, puts it on a -- on a car that 
rides along those rails for a couple of hundred yards
 
Is that enough to make the shipper a railroad? MR
 FREDERICK: I would -- I would concede the point of interchange at the port, Justice Scalia
 I don't think it's necessary for the Court to reach that
 
I will concede that point, so long as, you know, we are 
talking about an immediate nexus between the vessel and 
the ship
 And -- and that is not -- not a point that we have to prevail on to win in this case
 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you say here they own rail lines that --MR
 FREDERICK: There are  --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that go for -- 
Official MR
 FREDERICK: Well, there was no discovery because this was decided on the pleadings as a matter of 
law
 We believe that once discovery is permitted, if you allow the case to go back for factual development, 
that the facts would reveal that "K" Line was engaging 
in significant rail operations that at least get us 
beyond -- into the realm of legitimate advocacy
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When you say "engaging in," are you talking about vis-à-vis this shipment? MR
 FREDERICK: Yes
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or is it just in general? Vis-à-vis you? MR
 FREDERICK: Yes
 That's correct
 When my colleague here says that we take the position that Carmack cannot be contracted around, 
that is not true
 Our point here is that when there is exempt carriage, the STB has already defined this as 
something that can be provided by contract, but we believe 
that (e) says that they have to provide 
Carmack-compliant terms
 The industry will adapt to a decision by this Court in setting the background rules
 We would submit that the simpler regime and the one that the 
railroad had advocated in the international community 
was there -- was for there to be a U
S
 statute that 
Official applies and not to allow complete deregulation through 
contracts --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they -- they can't contract around liability for an event such as the 
one that happened here
 Because they have to offer Carmack-compliant terms, and if the owner of the goods 
has the option of accepting those, they can't contract 
around that
 MR
 FREDERICK: That's correct
 And -- and the point here about the forum is an important one, 
because Union Pacific has never thought that in these 
ocean bills of lading that that entitled American cargo 
interests to have to go to a foreign country under the 
ocean carrier's bill of lading in order to vindicate the 
interests in damage to their cargo
 That was an invention by "K" Line in this case after UP sought to 
remove it under the Carmack Amendment and transfer it to 
New York, and UP joined that motion and has argued 
throughout that the Carmack Amendment applies
 It would be unusual, to say the least, to allow UP now to take advantage of a contractual 
extension of COGSA where section  of COGSA, by its 
plain terms, in language that is completely ignored by 
the other side, says COGSA stops basically at the 
tackle-to-tackle period and does -- otherwise does not  
Official affect otherwise applicable law
 And there™s a specific reference in section  to the Harter Act and any other applicable law
 And in , when Congress enacted COGSA to implement the United States -- of the 
Hague rules, it was aware of the Carmack Amendment
 Thank you
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 Mr
 Ballenger, you have  minutes remaining
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J
 SCOTT BALLENGER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS MR
 BALLENGER: Thank you, Your Honor
 Even Respondents can't really bring themselves to say that Union Pacific is the receiving 
carrier here
 It's obviously not
 They say that somehow, UP could be liable as the delivering carrier 
under Carmack
 But of course, if "K" Line is not a rail carrier, there is no receiving carrier who is obligated 
to issue a bill of lading under Carmack
 No one is liable to under Carmack
 That is how the statute always worked from  to 
 If the receiving carrier was not governed by Carmack, as it was not in any import case and in any export case except 
for Canada and Mexico, then Carmack did not apply to 
anyone
 You can't parachute in midstream into the middle of a big movement and impose Carmack obligations at  
Official the midpoint, because that would turn the historic purpose of Carmack completely upside down
 It would read Carmack as mandating the commercial problem that Carmack was designed 
to solve
 The point of Carmack and of through bills under Carmack and COGSA is uniformity of responsibility 
under consistent terms for the whole voyage in one 
person
 And the reason is that in order to recover from anyone, the shipper has to prove receipt of the 
goods in good condition by that carrier, and if you 
break the chain of the through bill, then you would have 
to prove -- the shippers would have to prove that Union 
Pacific, for instance, received the property in good 
order, when as Respondents concede, all that Union Pacific gets is a sealed container
 It has no idea at that point
 And -- and so the shipper would be left in a position at the end of the day; it opens the container, there's damage; no one knows where it occurs; and there™s 
-- there™s no source of law, no source of fact to 
figure out where the damage occurred
 Respondents raise a lot of questions about some track that they say "K" Line owns from Long Beach 
to Los Angeles
 None of this is in the record, and it's  
Official waived at this point, Your Honor
 It's not actually true
 That's not "K" Line; it's an affiliate, and they don't provide rail transportation
 It's a Union Pacific subsidiary that provides the rail transportation
 But the real point is that all of this is far too late
 This case was decided on a rule (b)() motion to dismiss for improper venue, and the lower 
courts have made clear, sensibly, that if you are 
confronted with a forum selection motion to dismiss, you 
are required to at least come forward with any factual 
disputes that you think need to be resolved before the 
district court can grant or deny that motion
 It's far too late to wait until the Supreme Court of the United 
States, and say we have discovered some X number of 
miles of track --JUSTICE BREYER: How -- how do you get out of the language that says that a rail carrier providing 
transportation ﬁshall issue a receiptﬂ for property it 
receives? Now, the boat, oddly enough, is a rail carrier under the definition
 MR
 BALLENGER: The --JUSTICE BREYER: And, therefore, it should have issued -- since you agree it's a receiving 
character, it should have -- or -- it should have issued  
Official strongly to subparagraph (C), which is even farther 
away
 There™s -- there™s a period, a structural break, a new sentence
 The thought in the principal paragraph is certainly complete
 We™ve already been through some other sentencing factors, and now we™re --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, except that with --with (C), you -- you could say that traditionally 
recidivism has been a sentencing factor, and you cannot 
say with respect to (B) that whether it's a 
short-barreled rifle or a machinegun has traditionally 
been a sentencing factor
 To the contrary, it was an element
 MR
 HORWICH: Well, I disagree with that, Justice Scalia, because the tradition, as I understand 
it, is relevant because it might indicate what Congress 
was thinking or what suppositions it had in mind when it 
passed a statute
 And there™s a very -- there was a very different tradition at the time of the  enactment of 
the old statute and the  enactment of the new one, 
which is -- the big difference is that the sentencing 
guidelines came into effect in between those two times
 And the sentencing guidelines -- sentencing guideline K
, the principal determinant of base 
offense level in the sentencing guidelines for  
Official firearm-centric offenses in the Federal criminal law, was 
firearm type
 So it was unmistakably that -- it was unmistakable at the time in  when Congress enacted 
these -- these firearm-type provisions, that the 
sentencing guidelines were already making firearm type a 
sentencing consideration for the judge
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's -- let's talk about the guidelines
 Without the application of (B), the guidelines would provide for a much shorter sentence, 
wouldn't they? MR
 HORWICH: Well, the guidelines -- as before and as now for this offense, the guidelines level 
is the minimum
 JUSTICE SCALIA: The guidelines -- do you think that if under the guidelines the sentence was 
 years because of a machinegun, do you think that that 
would be upheld? MR
 HORWICH: I'm sorry
 And your -- if I understand you --JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think it would be upheld as a reasonable sentence under our Booker/Fanfan 
theory of -- of how the guidelines are to be applied? MR
 HORWICH: A reasonable -- well, certainly courts have, since Booker, imposed even up to 
a life sentence for offenses that did not otherwise  
Official trigger the elevated minimums
 There™s at least one case in the few years since Booker that implied a --
that imposed a life sentence for a -- for an offense 
that would have been subject only to the base -year 
maximum
 There are several that imposed -- imposed a life sentence for --JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is the life sentence maximum, by the way? I -- you say this is a minimum
 It's just a mandatory minimum because the maximum is specified to be life
 Where is that specified? MR
 HORWICH: The -- the maximum is not textually in the statute, but all courts that have looked 
at this have understood that
 Certainly, it seems to be the supposition of this Court's statutory holding in Harris 
that the nature of -- the structure of this -- of the 
sentencing provision here is that there's a life maximum, 
and then the firearm --JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where do you get the life maximum? I -- I'm reading through, and there's -- it mentions nothing about life
 MR
 HORWICH: Well, it is certainly the case, if we simply take (a)() --JUSTICE SCALIA: And if it mentions nothing about life, then these are not mandatory minimums
 To the contrary, they are -- they are new maximums
  
Official MR
 HORWICH: I absolutely disagree
 If it says ﬁat least,ﬂ that can only mean that there can be some 
-- a sentence higher than that
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the life part of the --MR
 HORWICH: Or not less than
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what the substantive crime was? Is it the attempted robbery or whatever it was? Is that -- because this is -- you're -- you™re saying this 
is an add-on to an underlying offense
 MR
 HORWICH: Well, I wouldn't describe it as an add-on
 It is a separate Federal crime, in -- in the sense -- in the sense that it is bad enough and 
dangerous enough to commit a drug trafficking offense 
or engage in a crime of --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then -- then you wouldn't be relying on what might be a life sentence 
for the underlying crime
 MR
 HORWICH: I -- oh, I'm sorry
 I -- I may have -- may have misspoken
 In response to Justice Scalia's question, my answer -- my answer was directed to imposing a life 
sentence on the (c) conviction, separate from 
whatever sentence may have been imposed on the --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but where do you get 
Official the maximum? You say, oh, these are just minimums
 MR
 HORWICH: Well, they are minimums because they say "not less than  years
" That applies --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But where is -- where is the maximum? MR
 HORWICH: The -- well, because there is no stated maximum, the -- the assumption then must be 
that a sentence higher than  years is appropriate
 
There is no --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there a Sixth Amendment problem with reading a statute this way, 
with -- with reading a statute to provide for an 
unlimited maximum when Congress hasn't specified it, and 
now you™re going to have the judge find the minimum and 
the maximum? MR
 HORWICH: Well, I don't -- I disagree that the judge is finding the maximum
 The -- the implied maximum term here is -- is life
 Congress --JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't find that implied at all
 I don't see why it's implied
 MR
 HORWICH: Well, the trouble, Justice Scalia, is then that I don't otherwise know what 
the maximum would be
 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right
 That™s --MR
 HORWICH: The maximum -- 
Official JUSTICE SCALIA: That's her question
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't there a Sixth Amendment problem with not knowing what you are exposed 
to? And then doesn't the minimum in that case sort of become de facto the maximum? JUSTICE SCALIA: I think what you are exposed to, as I read the statute, (c)()(A) does not 
impose a new sentence at all
 It just says there will be added to whatever the sentence is for the crime of 
violence or the drug trafficking crime -- there will be 
added to that sentence
 Then it says you™ll add  years; you™ll add  years; you™ll add  years
 Those are not mandatory minimums
 Those are add-ons to the sentence provided by the substantive 
crime to which (c)()(A) refers
 That way, the whole thing makes sense
 MR
 HORWICH: Well, I don't think it would make sense to treat them, as you are describing them, as 
add-ons
 There™s no question that this -- that this statute defines an offense that someone can be convicted 
of
 That certainly is the implication of this Court's holding in Deal
 It is a separate offense which therefore should carry its own punishment
 And the contrast --JUSTICE SCALIA: I™ll amend what I said
 
Official It is a mandatory minimum if the substantive crime 
referred to in (c)()(A) is above what is specified 
in -- in this statute
 But if it -- if it is below that, if the drug trafficking crime only provided for 
 years, and you did the crime with a machinegun, you 
get  years, that's an add-on
 MR
 HORWICH: Well, I -- I think it would be helpful then to compare this to the -- the language of 
the prior statute, which describes exactly what you are 
describing
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I got it
 MR
 HORWICH: Which is -- which is that whoever during or in relation, et cetera, et cetera, 
uses or carries a firearm --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give us the page? MR
 HORWICH: I'm sorry, this is at a of the petition appendix
 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's also on a of the government's brief
 MR
 HORWICH: Or a of the -- of the government's -- the government™s brief
 The old statute said exactly what you are describing, Justice Scalia, which is that whoever during 
or in relation to a crime of violence, et cetera, uses 
or carries a firearm shall, in addition to the  
Official punishment provided for such crime of violence, et cetera -- and then it specifies --JUSTICE SCALIA: Right
 MR
 HORWICH: -- particular determinate sentences
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right
 MR
 HORWICH: If Congress had wanted to continue that approach, I assume it would have kept that 
language
 It didn't
 It changed the language
 The new language says "be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 
not less than  years," which leaves -- which leaves --JUSTICE SCALIA: It says ﬁin addition toﬂ at the end of (c)()(A): ﬁWho, in furtherance – possesses a firearm shall, in addition to the punishment provided 
for by such crime of violence, be sentenced toﬂ  
years,  years,  years
 And then if the firearm, blah, blah, blah, is blah, blah, blah -- since 
your -- I assume that that introductory language "in 
addition to the punishment provided for" is implicit in 
(B)
 It's expressed in (A), but I think it's implicit in (B)
 MR
 HORWICH: That -- I understand that language, the in -- the "in addition to" language, to 
have -- to have been to make clear that this is a 
separate offense
 There is separate punishment for a  
Official separate conviction of this separate offense
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes
 MR
 HORWICH: And that then it is a separate -- then from there it is a question what is the 
appropriate sentence for a conviction on the offense 
described in (c)(), which is to say, well, it's a 
term of imprisonment of not less than  years, which 
holds open --JUSTICE SCALIA: In addition to the term that™s -- that exists for the substantive offense
 MR
 HORWICH: I -- I agree
 And if you look in subparagraph (D)(ii) it says that the term of 
imprisonment imposed under this subsection shall run 
consecutive to the other one, which -- which again shows 
that -- that the considerations for sentencing in this 
-- in this law are distinct from the -- it is a -- it is 
a separate question what the sentence on the (c) --JUSTICE BREYER: To make your life a little more complicated and difficult, though perhaps it makes 
it easier, we reach the questions that Justice Scalia 
was raising, I think, and they are important only if you 
win, only if we say that it is a sentencing factor
 If it is a new crime, we don't have any problem, because if 
it's a new crime, the jury has to find the fact
 But if it's a sentencing factor, then we get  
Official into the problem of Harris versus Apprendi
 And then you have to decide whether it's maximum, minimum, et cetera
 
But in Harris, I said that I thought Apprendi does cover 
mandatory minimums, but I don't accept Apprendi
 Well, at some point I guess I have to accept Apprendi, because 
it's the law and has been for some time
 So if and in fact, unfortunately for everyone, I was -- it was - in that, I think, so my vote 
mattered, and I don't know what other people think 
but in -- on this Court
 But if that becomes an issue, if that should become an issue about whether mandatory 
minimums are treated like the maximums for Apprendi 
purposes, should we reset the case for argument? Or do you feel, in your opinion that -- that you™ve had 
enough of an argument because you devoted two or three 
pages to this topic? MR
 HORWICH: Well, to answer -- well, first of all, there certainly has not been in -- in the 
briefing or argument here, any opportunity for this Court 
to consider what it would need to consider to overrule 
McMillan
 We™re not talking about overruling Harris
 We™re talking about overruling McMillan
 And --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I think basically Apprendi did significantly change McMillan, but that™s --MR
 HORWICH: Well, and that™s -- and that  
Official would be my -- my second point, is that -- is that since 
-- I think it has been become clearer since Harris that 
the rule in McMillan and the rule in Apprendi coexist 
quite well and coexist in a principled fashion, and 
that there is -- and that there is no -- Harris was 
correct in light of Apprendi, which is -- which is in 
the following respect
 JUSTICE BREYER: Does the government believe that it has sufficiently argued this, or would you suggest 
on the government's behalf that if it becomes an issue 
it's set for reargument? That was really my question
 MR
 HORWICH: Well, yes, we would certainly want to set it for reargument --JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the right answer
 MR
 HORWICH: -- obviously
 (Laughter
) MR
 HORWICH: But -- but I -- again, I don't even think that's necessary
 Respondents have offered nothing in the way of a justification for overruling 
Harris
 And again, the distinction is --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why can't we just say, as Judge Boudin did, they weren't -- this revision was on 
the books before Castillo was decided, so obviously 
Congress wasn't trying to adjust the statute in response 
to Castillo
 And they -- they made it read more easily
  
Official We know the one thing Congress was concerned with was adding 
possession, which was not there before
 So they added possession
 They made it more readable
 Some of the concerns that were expressed in Castillo are certainly present here
 There is a huge jump from a -year add-on to a -year add-on for -- for 
the machinegun
 So why don't we just say, well, this statute has been revised, but it wasn't in response to 
Castillo? It's not all that different
 MR
 HORWICH: Well, I disagree that it's not all that different
 And -- and for the following three -- for three reasons
 First of all, setting aside my disagreement with Justice Scalia, if you accept that 
the statutory maximum is life, as I believe every court 
to have confronted this understands it to be, then this 
statute belongs to an entirely different tradition than 
the tradition that Castillo belonged to, which is to 
say that this statute -- the -- the role of firearm type 
in this statute is to channel the sentencing judge's 
discretion by ruling out certain low sentences when 
certain facts are present, such as the presence of a 
machinegun
 That is something that when Congress wants to channel --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't a minimum always a  
Official maximum? MR
 HORWICH: No, I --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In -- to the person who would otherwise, in the judge's discretion, qualify for a 
lower sentence, doesn't it become that person's maximum 
once you have indiscretion? MR
 HORWICH: I disagree with that because the principle -- the background -- the basic principle 
behind Apprendi and our criminal law is that what you 
can rely on is what Congress has said in the statute or 
in -- as Booker holds --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What you can rely on in an indeterminate sentencing regime without a minimum is 
that you™ve got a statutory maximum, whatever it may 
be, but a judge's discretion to start from zero
 If that judge was inclined to give you zero, isn't the 
minimum then your statutory maximum? You're -- because that's what the judge has to give you
 MR
 HORWICH: I disagree with that, because it is not the only thing the judge can give you
 The full range of punishment above those minimums is 
available
 I was indicating earlier that --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel -- counsel, I think you had said you had three responses to Justice 
Ginsburg -- 
Official MR
 HORWICH: Yes
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and only got one out
 MR
 HORWICH: Right, and perhaps only half of that one, which is -- which is that in the -- on 
the question of -- of tradition, Congress apparently 
exclusively uses sentencing factors when it wants to do 
nothing more than give some rules to the judge to 
channel his discretion with minimum sentences
 We observed this in our opening brief, and Respondents said 
nothing in response
 As far as we know, every time Congress wants to channel a sentencing judge's discretion, it does it 
with a sentencing factor
 That is a difference
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right
 Number two? MR
 HORWICH: Number two is that the -- is that the -- the -- the linguistic change here, the 
textual change, the fact that subparagraph (D) says "a 
person convicted of a violation of this subsection
" 
That presupposes there has been a conviction, that the 
jury has been charged with whatever the elements of the 
offense are and that now what's going to be stated in 
clauses (B)(i) and (B)(ii) are things that are relevant 
at sentencing
 And then the third -- and then the third point is -- is that -- is essentially the structural 
Official change from -- that I alluded to earlier, of moving 
firearm type wholly away from the elements of the 
offense
 That made a difference to this Court in Harris
 It is -- it would be, I think, irreconcilable with this Court's holding in Harris to say that 
brandishing and discharge have been moved far enough 
away from the elements to make them sentencing factors, 
or rather are stated far enough away from the elements, 
structurally separated enough to make them 
sentencing factors, but then to --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those are all -- all three of those are -- are pretty subtle ways for 
Congress to change the view in Castillo
 MR
 HORWICH: Well, I would agree that --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Moving something from the body of the paragraph to a separate section and 
so on
 MR
 HORWICH: Well, I would -- I would point out -- of course, one has to -- one has to recognize what 
Congress had before it when it -- when it made the 
change, which is to say, when it -- when it embarked on 
these revisions, there was a one-to-one circuit split on 
the question
 And by the time it had finished making the changes, it was actually three to one in favor of 
sentencing factor interpretation in the old statute
  
Official Now, I agree that if Castillo had been on the books and Congress had said nothing about it, that 
might be a basis to say that Congress was acquiescing in 
that interpretation
 But it's -- it's -- Congress was certainly concerned with much more substantial issues in 
the revisions
 And the fact that it did not comment further should not be a reason to -- to not pay 
attention to the structural and textural changes that it 
did make
 I™d like to reserve
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 JUSTICE SCALIA: We have tall lawyers today
 What is this, tall lawyer day? (Laughter
) CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr
 Fisher
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L
 FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS MR
 FISHER: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think it's important at the outset to set the context for this case
 The government cannot point to a single defendant under this provision for the 
conduct at issue who has ever received more than 
 years in prison absent the use of a machinegun
 We cited a long string of cases in the 
Official O'Brien brief and the government's response in its reply 
brief was silent
 So, therefore, the government is here today claiming that it is entitled, based on the fact of 
a machinegun, to get  years more than any defendant 
that perpetrated this conduct has ever gotten, and 
indeed  more years than the government itself asked 
the district judge in this case for, once the machinegun 
provision was off the table, under the guise that this 
is nothing more than a sentencing factor
 We think that this Court's statutory interpretation jurisprudence as well, if necessary, this 
Court's constitutional jurisprudence foreclose such a 
result
 Let me start with statutory interpretation
 On the government's theory in , Congress stepped in 
and took a statute that made machinegun use an element 
and transformed it into -- into a sentencing factor
 In other words, Congress, without a peep, a mutter, or 
anything, and in -- in the course of doing something 
entirely different, which was reacting to this Court's 
Bailey decision, stepped in and took a fact that 
formerly had to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable 
doubt to trigger a -year sentence and left that same 
sentence in place but now allowed it to be proved to a 
judge by a preponderance, based on a presentence report,  
Official and, indeed, according to the government, also stripped 
away the mens rea requirement that attached to the 
statute when it was an element
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the short --what is it, the one that gets  years, the 
short-barreled rifle? That's -- that's -- those two are together in the statute, and you said that it would 
be startling because of the difference between  years 
and the  years, but the short-barreled rifle is the 
same amount of time in discharging, and discharging is a 
sentencing factor
 MR
 FISHER: We think, Justice Ginsburg, that if this Court had to construe that statute in a 
different case, that provision, it would find it's still 
an element
 Now, I grant that it™s a difference, a very significant difference between  and  years, but 
structurally it is an element
 And I think an -- a good way to go about understanding this -- I heard my -- my opponent today say 
that this would be indistinguishable from Harris or fly 
in the face of Harris
 Well, there's three very important differences between the machinegun provision at issue 
here and the discharge provision in Dean and the 
brandishing provision in Harris
 The first difference  
Official is that this an entirely separate subparagraph
 Now, if you imagine somebody amending the statute and wanting to accomplish what the government 
says was accomplished here, why wouldn't the firearm 
type provisions just have been (iv) and (v) under 
capital letter (A)? They™re not
 What the draftsperson did instead is break them out into an entirely separate, stand-alone 
provision
 As the AUSA described it, when he charged them in the alternative in the district of 
Massachusetts, he said I think it's a greater and lesser 
offense situation
 And that's what we think
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I guess I'm not following the ball here
 I thought the government had conceded that sub (i), sub (ii), sub (iii) under (A) are 
not sentencing factors but are elements
 Is that not --MR
 FISHER: I don't understand that to be what the government has said
 I believe the government's argument is that the big paragraph with 
capital letter (A) sets forth the elements, and then sub 
(i), (ii), and (iii) are merely sentencing factors
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, they have to because that's what Harris said, brandished --JUSTICE KENNEDY: That™s -- yes, that™s Harris
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- brandished is a  
Official sentencing factor
 MR
 FISHER: That's right
 That's right, Justice Ginsburg
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's even worse, then
 I agree with you
 (Laughter
) MR
 FISHER: So what sub (B) does, as I said, is it creates a greater offense, and so, it™s 
broken out in a way that incorporates the earlier 
elements up above in the main paragraph by using the 
phrase: If a ﬁfirearm possessed by a person convicted of a violation of this subsection
ﬂ That phrase, we believe, incorporates the earlier elements
 Remember in Harris this Court emphasized that the brandishing provision just kept 
going in the sentence and did not incorporate earlier 
elements
 So when the government stands here today and says, well, when you incorporate the earlier elements, 
that shows it™s a sentencing factor, too, it seems to me a 
situation of heads, I win; tails, you lose
 JUSTICE BREYER: No, their -- their -- their basic argument is look at the statute
 (A) has what is undoubtedly a set of sentencing factors
 Brandishing and discharging are as traditional as they come
 Then look  
Official at (C), and you find some other ones that are sentencing factors, because recidivism is as traditional as it 
comes
 And between those two they put (B)
 So since the neighbors, (A) and (C), are certainly sentencing, they must have meant (B) to be a 
sentencing factor, too
 I -- as I understand it, that is one of their basic arguments
 MR
 FISHER: Right
 And let me -- let me give two responses to that
 First of all, if you --if you look again at the appendix of the government's 
main brief, which is a and a, the guts of the 
statute is the ﬁuse or carryﬂ language or ﬁpossesses a firearmﬂ 
language in the main paragraph
 And then, the -- from the ﬁpossessedﬂ language down through sub (iii), what you have is the Bailey fix 
right there
 So, then what happens --JUSTICE SCALIA: And you believe there is a background of life sentence? You agree with the government that --MR
 FISHER: I don't think that™s necessarily the case, Justice Scalia
 This Court --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it either is or isn't
 You --MR
 FISHER: -- has said a couple of times that this is a theoretical maximum sentence, but, surely,  
Official if nothing else, the Sentencing Reform Act sets a maximum sentence here if it's not just a straight 
determinant sentence
 And we've argued at length in the O'Brien brief that the reasonableness requirement under  of 
the Sentencing Reform Act would have to set a maximum 
sentence
 And for the reason I said at the outset, given that no one has ever received more than  years 
absent a machinegun here, certainly that maximum 
sentence would be far less than life and far less than  years
 But --JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the -- I don't want to interrupt your nice organization here
 But what is the principle, the general rule, that you articulate to support the distinction between  being necessarily an 
element and  a sentencing factor? What's the general rule here? MR
 FISHER: Let me answer it --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than, this is just --MR
 FISHER: If I might say one more --JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- other than how awful this is
 MR
 FISHER: If I might say one more sentence to Justice Breyer, and then I™ll answer that
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Please
  
Official MR
 FISHER: Justice Breyer, the other thing I'd point out is that, so therefore, once you make the 
Bailey fix, you just come -- in the old statute, then 
you come to the machinegun provision, and you just leave 
it where it was
 And, in fact, there are plenty of statutes that we™ve cited in both briefs where there are 
elements in the middle, sandwiched between sentencing 
factors
 Now, Justice Kennedy, you asked the general principle
 The general principle is this, at least in terms of this Court's Sixth Amendment law, is that: The critical question to ask is whether the defendant could 
receive the sentence the government seeks without the 
fact at issue
 Seven years is a sentence the defendant here could receive without the machinegun finding
 Thirty years is absolutely off bounds
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that just based on empirical studies or is there guideline support for 
that? MR
 FISHER: There is both, Your Honor
 Of course, the guidelines are not binding --JUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand
 I understand that
 MR
 FISHER: -- but the guideline sentences 
Official as -- as to this statute are pegged exactly to the 
mandatory minimums
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry
 Could otherwise receive under what? The sentence -- you say  years is a sentence he could otherwise receive
 MR
 FISHER: Under the facts that either we prove to the jury or are admitted by the defendant
 
So -- so in this case, the defendant could receive  
years, and we've conceded that
 JUSTICE SCALIA: There must be some statutory provision that you -- that you -- that you 
rely upon
 MR
 FISHER: Oh, certainly, Justice Scalia
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where does  years come from? MR
 FISHER: Seven years comes from -- comes from the statute, for brandishing, which is what both 
defendants had admitted that they did
 Seven years --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but we know that's a sentencing factor
 MR
 FISHER: But they've admitted it
 So they've waived any Sixth Amendment right as to that 
sentencing factor
 We're willing to concede that
 But then you go to the guidelines, which sets a 
-year -- a -year recommended sentence
  
Official Under this Court's jurisprudence following Booker, we know that we take that recommendation and we 
plug it into section (a), which, if you want the 
statutory language, directs that a sentence ﬁno greater 
than necessary to serve the following factorsﬂ be 
introduced -- I'm sorry, be imposed
 And when you look at those factors, disparity is a factor this Court has 
left in place and emphasized at every term since Booker, 
and the guideline sentence
 And when you put -- plug those things into the facts here, we simply suggest 
there is no way that it would be upheld as substantively 
reasonable if the defendant got  years absent the 
machinegun fact here
 And we™ve also cited in our brief several places where the government itself makes this -- the 
mirror image of the argument that I'm making in the 
post-Booker, Gall, Rita world, when judges deviate 
downward from the guidelines
 They emphasize -- we quoted one Eleventh Circuit case in our brief where the 
government got overturned, as substantively unreasonable, 
a downward variance from a guideline recommendation, 
because no defendant had ever received such a low 
sentence
 But I don't have to, of course, hang my hat on this -- on the strict application of Apprendi here
 
Official We think there's also an even deeper problem that 
predates this Court's Apprendi jurisprudence, which was 
flagged by this Court as early as McMillan, where this 
Court said that if what Congress does is step in 
and manipulate the elements of a crime in order 
to relieve the government of its obligation to prove 
ordinary and traditional elements, then we have a pure 
due process problem, irrespective of any Sixth Amendment 
problem
 Now, this Court has never found such a problem, but I would emphasize that the --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do we find it with this statute, if there™s a -year minimum/maximum 
under (A) subdivision (iii) if the firearm is 
discharged, and it's  years; and if it's a 
short-barreled rifle under (B), it's also an equal 
amount, of  years? I think that's what Justice Ginsburg was pointing to
 So the question I have for you is: How do we find substantive unreasonableness? MR
 FISHER: How do we find substantively unreasonable after Booker? JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Unreasonableness, that there was an act of manipulation here, or intent to 
manipulate
  
Official MR
 FISHER: Well, if you™re asking me the question -- I want to be sure I understand and answer the 
question
 If you™re asking me how applying the principle this Court first articulated in McMillan, and 
you apply it here --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly
 MR
 FISHER: I don't think you have to look any further -- well, there is two places you can look
 
You can look both at the intent of Congress and the 
effect of what it did
 The intent of Congress, at least as hypothesized by the Solicitor General, is laid out at 
page  of its merits brief, where it says: What Congress was intending to do here is, quote, "simplify 
and streamline guilt-stage proceedings" by relieving the 
government of its burden to prove this case -- this fact 
beyond a reasonable doubt to the judge
 So that strikes one as, as this Court put it in Harris, an intent to 
evade the ordinary requirements in the Fifth and Sixth 
Amendments
 Then, as to effect, you can look at what I've also -- what I've already emphasized, which is that 
this sentence simply is not otherwise available, absent 
that fact
 And that, on its own, ought to tell this Court that it's dealing with an element
 
Official But if it wants to dig even deeper, it could -- it could describe it in terms of a -year increase over what the defendant would otherwise get or what, 
indeed, as we™ve said, anyone has ever gotten for this act, 
absent a machinegun
 It could do it in terms of percentage and say it's  percent higher; the Court used the phrase once, 
"tail wagging the dog
" I don't think it matters exactly what exact avenue this Court would pick
 Again, if it were doing a constitutional analysis -- I™m 
speaking right now constitutionally instead of 
statutorily -- it would all end up at the same place
 But I want to make sure that I understood your question also, with due respect to you, Justice 
Ginsburg, because what I was talking about was  years under 
(A)(iii), of course, is a sentencing factor, as this Court 
held in Dean, whereas under (B)(i), the same length of a 
sentence might be an element
 That was a matter -- that was a statutory answer, and I think, as a matter of statutory construction, which is, of course, the first thing you're going to address in this case, what we 
think we can win on without even reaching the 
constitutional questions
 And the differences would be, apart from the same sentence, you have the structural 
difference that I've emphasized
 You have the tradition
 And let me say a word about tradition, if I 
Official might
 The government emphasizes the guidelines and other kinds of statutes
 When this Court applies the tradition canon that it established in Almendarez-Torres 
and Castillo, I don't know why you have to look any 
further than Castillo itself to answer the tradition 
question
 In Jones, as this Court put it, the reason we look to tradition is because if it's a close case, we™re 
going to not assume that Congress intended a radical 
departure from past practice
 Well, the past practice here is absolutely unequivocal
 This Court held in Castillo, -, that Congress intended this to be an 
element
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the Court's --the Court's opinion in Castillo quite carefully noted 
that it wasn't addressing this statute
 I think it's a little bit of a bait-and-switch to say that, well, 
Castillo decides this case
 MR
 FISHER: I don't contend that Castillo absolutely decides the case
 My contention that I was trying to make is that when this Court looks to 
tradition for purposes of construing the new amendments, 
that Castillo gives the answer on -- at least on 
tradition, at least as applying that particular 
question
 Because Congress, we know, intended it to be an element at least until 
  
Official But I think that even -- even if you were to step back from the Castillo analysis itself and the 
Castillo factors themselves, you would also, I think, do 
well to give -- again, not dispositive, but -- but 
careful treatment to Castillo, because Congress steps 
in, of course, and amends statutes all the time
 They step in and they amend one portion of a statute, and 
while they are at it, we know from the manuals that we've 
cited and from the examples in the back of the O'Brien 
brief that Congress often, while they™re amending one 
part, they reorganize or reword other parts of the 
statute
 And this Court, across its statutory interpretation jurisprudence, within criminal law and 
outside, has always said that once we say the law means 
something, we're not going to assume that Congress 
changed the law unless we get some sort of clear 
indication from Congress that it -- that it intended to 
change the law
 Now, here, as I think has been emphasized, but I™ll just reiterate, there™s not a peep of 
anything in the legislative history or anything to 
suggest that Congress was -- was intending to change the 
law here
 And, in fact, it's not even a mere silence case
 We know quite clearly and affirmatively that 
Official Congress was intending to do something entirely 
different, which was respond to this Court's Bailey 
decision
 But even in the language -- and the only thing I think the Solicitor General even has for it in 
this case is the language and structure, which are some 
different words and different placement that it can at 
least build an argument off of, because the other four 
of the five Castillo factors are entirely unchanged
 
But even the language, we submit, is a far cry from the 
kind of change this Court ought to require before it 
does a -degree switch as to what it had said the 
prior law meant
 Just for purposes of stability in the law, if nothing else, I think this -- it behooves this Court 
to take its prior decisions seriously and to -- and to 
engage in a dialogue with Congress that encourages 
Congress to be clear when it wants to change what the 
prior law is
 JUSTICE SCALIA: The prior statute -- which was  U
S
C
 (c)(), right? That did deal with short-barreled rifle, short-barreled shotgun, 
machinegun, and so forth, but that's -- that provision 
didn't say anything about brandishing or discharge
 
Where -- what was -- how were they treated under the  
Official prior law? MR
 FISHER: They -- as you say, they were not in the statute itself
 My understanding is that judges as -- on an ad hoc basis, would have treated 
those as sentencing factors
 And what Congress did -- when it came in to respond to this Court's Bailey decision, I think it 
codified all of the different manners of using the gun 
in the context of one of these crimes
 So it not just dealt with, yes, possessing ought to be covered, but it 
talked about other manners, brandishing and discharging
 
In Castillo, this Court emphasized again the big 
difference between manner of using a gun and the type of 
firearm which lies at the core of this offense
 If I would turn -- if I would leave the Court with nothing else, let me emphasize again to the 
Court the difference between this statute, which I think 
the government wants you to think is no different in 
intent, effect, or operation than the two that this 
Court prior -- dealt with in Harris, as a matter of both 
statutory construction and constitutional law, and in 
McMillan, as a matter of constitutional law
 What this Court emphasized in both of those cases was that there was a preexisting law on the books 
that criminalized certain activity
 And then a  
Official legislature later stepped in and set a mandatory minimum 
for a particular fact that could accompany the crime at 
issue
 And it did so in a very minor way
 For example, in Pennsylvania, the various crimes covered by the 
firearm mandatory minimum in that case gave -, -year 
sentences routinely, and all the Pennsylvania 
legislature did was step in and say: If he uses a gun, we want at least  years
 And in Harris, as I've just emphasized, I think, in discussing with 
Justice Scalia, the Court dealt with a bump of just  
years
 Again, what judges were already customarily doing, I think, under the statute
 Here, this is entirely and dramatically different
 Here, the fact allows a sentence -- indeed, requires a sentence -- that is  years longer than 
anyone has ever gotten for this conduct at issue
 That is a difference not just -- it's not a minor difference
 
It is a categorically different difference that we think 
is enough, combined with other principles of statutory 
and constitutional interpretation, to -- I'm sorry, 
statutory interpretation to resolve this case on the 
statute alone
 But if you need to look to the Constitution, we think that the Sixth Amendment, either as the 
bright-line rule articulated in Apprendi dictates that  
Official any fact that allows a greater sentence than the defendant could otherwise receive is subject to the 
Sixth Amendment, or sort of plain, pure due process, 
tail-that-wags-the-dog analysis, that this Court 
emphasized in McMillan -- either of those would be 
enough, and indeed require, a finding of 
unconstitutionality here and a finding this Court can avoid
 And if nothing else, Justice Breyer, I would say that we think that this case can be resolved on statutory grounds
 We think there are narrower constitutional arguments that would either require reading it narrowly 
or striking it down if you had to, on even narrower 
grounds
 But if nothing else, then we would ask this Court to revisit Harris, if necessary
 We don't think it's necessary to resolve the case for us here, but we think that would be appropriate 
if it -- if it needed to get there
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a collateral point: Does the government have to show, or does the -- don't 
you have to find that the machinegun is operable? MR
 FISHER: I assume so, but I don't know the specific answer to that, Justice Kennedy
 What there is a dispute about, of course, is whether the --
if it were a sentencing factor, whether the government  
Official has to prove knowledge
 And we do emphasize that that would be an alternative basis for this Court to decide 
this case, by saying you at least have to prove 
knowledge even if it™s a sentencing factor
 And let me just leave you with this, unless there are any further questions: The government makes a couple points in its reply brief suggesting that certain 
arguments were not preserved or made properly in this 
case
 The knowledge argument that I just referred to is raised in the brief in opposition for Mr
 O'Brien at 
pages  to 
 So under rule  of this Court, that argument was properly presented at the cert stage
 You will also find that argument at pages  to  of the Joint 
Appendix
 Also with respect to the Sixth Amendment substantive reasonableness as-applied argument, the 
government suggests that for some reason, that would be 
inappropriate for this Court to reach or rely on
 
Again, we disagree
 First of all, we can't understand why it would be inappropriate to reach or rely on that 
constitutional argument, whereas it is apparently 
appropriate for this Court to address the McMillan 
argument or the ﬁoverrule Harrisﬂ argument
 They™re all three constitutional arguments that are present in 
this case
 And, again, if there were any doubt they  
 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the States don't have the same compulsion that the Federal Government has, 
which arises from the separation of powers
 which -- which means that it is the executive that has 
the right to prosecute, and States are not bound by such 
a thing
 And they can perhaps allow private individuals to prosecute, whereas the only exception we have made 
from the -- from the chief executive's authority to 
prosecute is Young, which is a very narrow exception, 
dealing with the Court's ability to protect itself from 
contempt of its orders
 And here the court had nothing to do with the appointment of this private party, right? MS
 FRANKFURT: That's absolutely true
 In our view to the extent there are any sort of exceptions 
from procedural rights or the normal process in contempt 
proceedings, they are narrowly tailored and governed by 
the doctrine of necessity
 And that -- and so while Respondent's counsel indicates, well, there are a lot of 
differences in contempt and just add one to this list, 
they make no attempt to ground that in the document of 
necessity, which is really the only thing that -- that 
justifies any sort of procedural difference in the 
contempt context
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I right that the 
 District has been following this procedure for quite 
some time? MS
 FRANKFURT: Yes
 Well, I guess it depends on what the question what "this procedure" is
 
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, where a private party initiates, the beneficiary of an order of this 
kind, initiates a contempt proceeding against a person 
who violates it, and seeks a punishment for it, not just 
discontinuance
 MS
 FRANKFURT: Yes
 The -- the District had a case where it said it believed itself not bound by 
the supervisory authority of Young and it would allow 
interested parties to prosecute contempt in the domestic 
violence context only, not outside the domestic violence 
context
 And it has had cases prosecuted in that fashion since that time, which I believe was 
 But it has -- it was not until this case that the issue 
arose because of the plea agreement to suggest that that 
JUSTICE STEVENS: It doesn't say to me that the plea agreement goes to the question of whether there 
is sort of an inherent violation of the Constitution by 
adopting this procedure at all
 MS
 FRANKFURT:  
 JUSTICE STEVENS: I have trouble figuring out whether the plea agreement has any relevance to the 
kind of basic argument you are making
 MS
 FRANKFURT: Well, we actually see two arguments, and maybe that's -- that we are making, which 
may be part of the confusion
 If this proceeding really was, as the lower court interpreted, the lower court -- the lower court 
interpreted the local statute and what occurred and 
said: This really was a private right of action brought by Ms
 Watson on her own behalf; no government party 
initiated it, controlled it; and we believe that is 
constitutional
 That's what the lower court said
 If that's what occurred, then we believe this Court could 
well say that is unconstitutional
 We -- we defer to the lower court's view of what occurred pursuant to the local statute
 This was a private right of action, the lower court told us so, and 
we don't think that the Constitution can tolerate such a 
thing
 And, therefore, like in Gompers where criminal penalty was imposed, Gompers v
 Buck's Stove, a criminal 
penalty was imposed in an action between private 
parties, that judgment must be set aside
 She never had power to invoke the authority of the court in the first 
place
 That's one way to view it
 The Solicitor 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or just to say the lower MS
 FRANKFURT: The lower court was wrong
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- on that premise
 MS
 FRANKFURT: JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We have another option, once we say they were wrong on that premise, to send it 
back and let them look at the second question, which is 
whether or not a private party can bring an action in 
the name of the sovereign
 MS
 FRANKFURT: Well, I think that the second way to view it, as -- as I was going to say, is 
what the Solicitor General of the United States now 
agrees -- they thought below that it was Constitution, 
but they now agree that the Constitution cannot tolerate 
private criminal rights of action
 JUSTICE STEVENS: And if -- if that's true, they have been following an unconstitutional practice 
for about  years; is that right? MS
 FRANKFURT: JUSTICE STEVENS: And nobody thought about it in all this time? MS
 FRANKFURT: And certainly since, you know, since they made the argument to the lower courts
  
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because it is done many, many times, as I understand it, over the years
 MS
 FRANKFURT: It was done many times, received -- when the original -- when the interested 
prosecutor decision was made, it was made on the same 
foundational premise as Young, which was let's look and 
see if we are concerned about conflict of interest
 By the nature of asking, the court asking questions of conflict of interest, the court was 
thinking of the woman as representing the government
 JUSTICE SCALIA: This wouldn't be allowed under Young
 I mean, if Young made anything clear is you couldn't appoint as a prosecutor an interested 
party
 And here is the most the interested party of all
 MS
 FRANKFURT: That's true
 It certainly JUSTICE SCALIA: So don't -- don't -- don't say that Young would have allowed it
 MS
 FRANKFURT: No, no, no, no
 It certainly wouldn't be allowed under Young
 But to finish my -- my answer to Justice Sotomayor and Justice 
Stevens as to the second route: If this Court -- what the Solicitor General I believe is asking this Court to 
do is to say it's not constitutional to have such an 
 action brought on behalf of a private party, therefore, 
construe it as an action brought on behalf of the 
sovereign
 This Court -- if this Court goes that route, as opposed to deferring to the way the lower court 
described it, rather says this must have been on behalf 
of the sovereign, the sovereign was the United States, 
then the question is whether the plea agreement barred 
it
 The lower court said the plea agreement didn't bar it because it was Ms
 Watson's; obviously it 
didn't bar it
 Ms
 Watson is not the United States
 But if in fact it was on behalf of the United States, 
then the question is does the plea agreement bar it
 We JUSTICE SCALIA: Does -- does the Justice Department concede that the sovereign here is the United 
States? MS
 FRANKFURT: JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that there can't be a separate prosecutor from -- from the Assistant United 
States Attorney and that is the prosecutor for the 
District of Columbia? MS
 FRANKFURT: I -- I don't want to speak  
 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't understand them to be saying that? MS
 FRANKFURT: that they concede that the -- the relevant sovereign is 
the United States
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we can ask the government
 MS
 FRANKFURT: Yes
 (Laughter
) MS
 FRANKFURT: But -- but I believe that's what their brief said
 They certainly said that below and I believe that's what they are saying here because 
they are saying it's prosecution on behalf of the United 
States
 They have given section  permission in this case because they believe that the United States is 
interested
 And so the District of Columbia's role, oddly enough, all the way through this proceeding and 
then they withdrew at the merits stage in this Court, 
was they believed themselves representing the 
Petitioner
 They had never perceived themselves to be a public prosecutor
 And they in fact said in the lower court that they had no authority to prosecute contempt 
in the District of Columbia
 We agree with that
 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Have -- have we had cases that said that Federal separation of powers principles 
are binding on territorial governments, for instance? MS
 FRANKFURT: You know, I -- I think that the question is -- I don't think -- I disagree with the 
government, with Respondents that this Court has said it 
hasn't
 I think in -- I think Springer appears to apply separation of powers principles
 I think that Metropolitan Airport Authority used Springer in a 
separation of powers -- a constitutional separation of 
powers analysis
 I think even if this Court looks at Whalen, which involves D
C
, we will see a separation of 
powers analysis applicable to the District of Columbia
 
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is the District a territory? MS
 FRANKFURT: I don't think we are a territory, no
 No, it is Article I power that is being exercised
 Our focus hasn't been entirely separation of powers, because in our view, you know, separation of 
powers is about the division of powers within 
government
 Here the problem was that the problem was that the -- there is no authority under the Constitution 
to give the power to prosecute time, which has 
historically, way back, been an attribute of sovereignty 
 and to take it entirely away from the sovereign at all
 Which is what -- what the lower court finding was and what Ms
 Watson now defends
 But we see a long, long history in the common law, in the English 
common law, in our common law, and in our constitutional 
jurisprudence of criminal actions being public wrongs 
prosecuted acting on behalf of the sovereign and 
criminal contempt falling right within that even more 
so, because this is indication of public authority, and 
to the extent there are any deviations from due process 
or separation of powers principles, they are justified 
only by the doctrine of necessity
 If the Court has no further questions, I JUSTICE STEVENS: Could I -- I have this question
 This -- again, I'm trying to see the case in the broad -- in the broader sense
 Supposing there is a civil lawsuit that's settled and part of the settlement is a consent decree 
that would enjoin certain conduct, and the defendant 
then violates the decree and engages in the prohibited 
conduct
 Are you saying that the only person who could prosecute for contempt would be the sovereign? MS
 FRANKFURT: For criminal contempt? JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes
  
 MS
 FRANKFURT: Yes
 Now whether -- whether in some situations a private prosecutor could be 
JUSTICE STEVENS: So, no, the question would be whether the lawyer for the -- the party who entered 
into the settlement could bring a contempt proceeding 
against the adversary who had violated the settlement
 MS
 FRANKFURT: On their own behalf? I don't -- I don't believe so
 Not a criminal contempt proceeding
 We are drawing a fairly rigid distinction between who the lawyer is and who the lawyer represents
 
In our view, the party in a criminal action has to be 
the sovereign, the United States
 Now in the contempt context there is a limited exception for appointment of private prosecutors 
when the executive is declining to prosecute and the 
judiciary needs to vindicate its authority, and if it's 
referred to the public prosecutor in the Young situation 
and the public prosecutor has declined but the judiciary 
still needs to vindicate its authority, it can appoint a 
private attorney to represent the sovereign
 But at root it's the sovereign that is prosecuting, no matter who the lawyer is who is standing 
in the courtroom
 And the problem in this case was the 
 holding of the lower court that said -- that Ms
 
Watson -- it was her case
 The prosecutor said it was her case; the lawyer said I can't control her; she gets 
to make all the decisions
 JUSTICE STEVENS: What do you think the best authority from this Court for your basic proposition is? 
What is your strongest case? MS
 FRANKFURT: I think the strongest case is Gompers v
 Buck's Stove
 and I'm not quoting verbatim -- but it says 
fundamentally erroneous as if a tort action of A -- for 
battery of A versus B, a sentence of  months is 
imposed
 Well, that's exactly what we have here, is we have a sentence of  months imposed for an action that 
our lower court said was solely between private parties
 JUSTICE STEVENS: You think Gompers is the best case? MS
 FRANKFURT: Yes, I do
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what is your position 
if there is a plea bargain in the Southern District of 
New York, does it -- does bind, do you think, the 
prosecutor in the Eastern District? What is your view of that proposition? I know it's not part of this case
 MS
 FRANKFURT: Right
 My view is this  
 Court should go with the Third and Fourth Circuits who 
have -- expressed -- quite eloquently about the United 
States not being a bunch of separate fiefdoms, but that 
when the United States speaks, they speak for the 
government at large
 of some of the cases that were cited, where it says the 
United States will make a recommendation to the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, and then the 
criminal defendant comes back and says well, the INS is 
down, too
 And people looks at the agreement and say well, no one would have read that to mean that the 
United States included INS, because they were talking 
about a recommendation to INS
 But when the government has written in, my view is that -- that the Third Circuit and the Fourth 
Circuit speak eloquently to that
 But I don't see that that issue is presented here, given the context on which 
it arises in D
C
 where this is conduct that should only 
be prosecuted in D
C
 court by the United States
 It was going to be the United States Attorney or a private 
prosecutor representing the United States
 We have local law that says private prosecutors do sign plea 
agreements by the United States and I would think the 
converse would be true
  
 I'll reserve
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 MS
 FRANKFURT: Thank you
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr
 Long
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A
 LONG ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MR
 LONG: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think it's very important to be clear about what is properly before the Court
 This started out as a case about a plea agreement, and the 
Petitioner's claim is that his plea agreement with the U
S
 Attorney barred his criminal contempt proceeding
 He has not made the claim that a private interested 
party may not bring a criminal contempt proceeding
 He CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but the argument is that because a private interested party 
can't bring it, the party is bringing it on behalf of 
the United States and his plea agreement therefore is 
with the United States
 MR
 LONG: Well, I mean if I could, Mr
 Chief Justice, there are I think several questions 
in the case, and some are actually no longer in dispute 
so that will help to simplify a very complicated matter 
 a little bit
 One is according to the question presented, whether the criminal contempt proceeding for violating a 
civil protective order must be brought in the name of 
the United States, so actually have United States in the 
caption
 And I think now all the parties agree, there is no constitutional requirement that the caption of the 
case actually say "United States
" So to the extent that answers the question about what does the plea 
agreement cover, we don't have a dispute about that
 
There's no constitutional reason why the court of 
appeals has to be reversed
 So the other part of the question, as it's framed in the question is does it have to be brought 
pursuant to the power of the United States
 That's not JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I'm not sure I understand your point
 Yes, the caption doesn't have to MR
 LONG: Yes
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the prosecuting MR
 LONG: Yes
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the person whose name is listed is acting for someone
  
 MR
 LONG: Yes
 Is the real party in interest the United States? JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly
 MR
 LONG: And I agree, that's mostly what we have to talk about this morning, but I'm trying to 
bracket it with issues that are really not properly in 
dispute here
 One is, the caption is not a constitutional issue
 Another is, as Petitioner has said over and over again, the actual ability of a private, interested 
party, the question that was left open in Young, under 
the Constitution, under the Due Process Clause or under 
separation of powers, is that constitutional for 
Ms
 Watson to even do this, as the representative of the 
United States or on her own behalf? They have said over and over again, they are not raising that question
 In their reply brief to the court of appeals, they say they in no way challenge 
that
 In their post-argument brief to the court of appeals, they say the assertion that they are 
challenging it is just wrong
 In their supplemental 
they decline to raise that question
 And even in their reply brief here, they say they have not raised the 
issue left unresolved in Young
 
 So that is a very important issue
 And I JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you define what you see as that issue? MR
 LONG: That's the issue of whether a private interested party, either on their own behalf or 
as the representative of the sovereign, can bring a 
criminal contempt action
 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean? Not on their own -- not on their own behalf
 that's a quite different issue
 That's the issue that MR
 LONG: Yes
 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- whether a private interested party can be authorized to bring the suit on 
behalf of the sovereign
 MR
 LONG: Yes
 What I'm trying to do is JUSTICE SCALIA: you covered two things
 You said whether a private individual can bring it on his own
 MR
 LONG: Right
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or whether a private individual can be appointed to bring it on behalf of the 
sovereign
 
 MR
 LONG: Yes
 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I thought it was only -- only the second of these that you say is out of 
the case
 You say the first is out of the case, too? MR
 LONG: No
 JUSTICE SCALIA: No
 MR
 LONG: I think -- I think the -- all they have conceded is that for purposes of this case, we 
are going to assume that -- well, I may have given you 
the wrong answer to you -- we are -- they have said over 
and over again, we assume, that a private interested 
party can bring a criminal contempt proceeding
 And so CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As representative of the sovereign? MR
 LONG: Well, I -- I think that question is fairly before the Court
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And nobody doubts --I didn't think it was at issue that the United States, 
rather than operating through the Assistant U
S
 
Attorney, can appoint you to handle the prosecution
 MR
 LONG: Exactly
 Exactly
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's what they don't dispute, right? MR
 LONG: Maybe a different way of making 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: they don't dispute that? That's the point you were trying to make? MR
 LONG: Yes
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, repeat it for me
 MR
 LONG: The point is, they are not disputing, and they've said over and over again they're 
not disputing that a private, interested individual, 
like Ms
 Watson, the individual in this case, can bring 
this proceeding
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: On whose behalf? That's MR
 LONG: And the issue that I think is before the Court is, would that be as a representative 
of the United States or would that be as a private 
person? JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay
 Are you saying that it's out of the case that if we say it's on behalf 
of the United States, they are not challenging that they 
can do that? MR
 LONG: Yes
 Yes
 I think they have not challenged that
  
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's so -- so if we MR
 LONG: Yes
 And I will say, there is an oddity to this, because in many ways, the bigger 
question is the question that the Court left open in 
Young, since that's not been properly raised, not 
properly decided, by the court below, not properly 
briefed, it is a little odd to be answering this other 
question of: Well, assuming that the private party can do this, would it be in the interest of the United 
States? JUSTICE BREYER: So in other words, if, in fact -- you agree or don't agree, I don't know -- but 
the government says and they say, the government of the 
United States has here -- and it can, under the 
Constitution, delegate to a private person the authority 
to prosecute
 MR
 LONG: Right
 JUSTICE BREYER: There is a big argument against that
 MR
 LONG: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: The argument is: This would be the one person you can't delegate it to because 
they are very biased
 MR
 LONG: Right
 
 JUSTICE BREYER: And that argument, you say, is not in this case
 MR
 LONG: Exactly
 Exactly
 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay
 So now we have what is in the case, which is the question of whether, 
MR
 LONG: So let me now address the point that: Is it a constitutional requirement? No matter what the legislature says, that any criminal contempt 
proceeding must be brought in the interest of the 
sovereign, not in the interest of a private party
 That may seem like a fairly obvious proposition, but I want 
to submit it's actually much harder than the Court 
actually should agree
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you mean by "in the interest of"? On behalf of? Is that what you mean? Are you saying -- you acknowledge here that it is on behalf of the United States but you say it 
doesn't have to be in the interest of the United States, 
is that it? MR
 LONG: Well, the language that the court of appeals used is in the interest of the United States
 
Who is the real party in interest? JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what that means
 Are you asserting that this suit has been 
 brought on behalf of the United States by your client? MR
 LONG: No
 I want to make an argument that actually, the D
C
 legislature and the D
C
 courts 
are constitutionally permitted to determine that in this 
specific situation, the interests of the individual 
actually predominate over the interests of the 
government and there is not a constitutional problem
 JUSTICE ALITO: Why is that even relevant? Why do you even get to that? Isn't the question what the parties understood the plea agreement to mean? MR
 LONG: Well, I agree with you completely Justice Alito
 The ultimate question is exactly what you say
 And we think under any reasonable construction of the plea agreement, it does not bar this proceeding
 
As Justice Stevens said, these have gone on for
 JUSTICE BREYER: It's highly relevant, I think, because I think you would you like to make the 
argument, which I would like to hear, is that: Forget the United States
 The Constitution permits this woman to bring the case as a private citizen
 MR
 LONG: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, if you are right about that, the plea agreement drops out
 MR
 LONG: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: Because nobody says made a  
 plea agreement with her
 Because that is the argument you want to make at some point
 (Laughter
) MR
 LONG: I will make the argument, although if I am wrong, I still think the plea agreement 
doesn't bar this prosecution
 JUSTICE ALITO: But, well -- well, with respect, even if the Constitution permits this, if the 
parties understood the plea agreement to mean that this 
was going to be barred, then why isn't that the end of 
the matter? MR
 LONG: Well, it's what a reasonable person would have understood Justice Alito, when the 
plea agreement says, crosses out District of Columbia, 
crosses out corporation counsel, and we are now all 
agreed that Ms
 Watson, in her own name, can bring this 
proceeding under a statute that authorizes it and has 
JUSTICE ALITO: And I suppose the argument could be that the -- that the government has no 
authority under D
C
 law to enter into such an 
MR
 LONG: Well, that's -- now we are getting into statutory issues, Justice Alito
 I mean, this case is a constitutional case, with no such  
 statutory issue was raised or decided by the court 
below
 Typically, this Court treats the D
C
 court of appeals as -- as final, as a practical matter, on issues 
of D
C
 law
 So, I think that is going off in a completely different direction
JUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, I have really lost you
 What is going off in a different direction? Really? (Laughter
) MR
 LONG: The issue is, it's a matter of D
C
 statute
 There was some problem with this prosecution
 I mean, that's really something else
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, okay
 you're asserting that this agreement with the United 
States Attorney cannot cover this case because your 
client was not acting on behalf of the United States, 
but rather in her private capacity
 MR
 LONG: Yes, and let me make that argument
 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's perfectly okay, right? MR
 LONG: If -- if that is a constitutional requirement
 It is in Blackstone, we admit that, for crimes in general, but we are talking about contempt
  
 But if it's a constitutional requirement, it has got to 
be in the Constitution someplace
 Petitioners say it's because the Constitution uses words like "crimes
" Well, you know, the Court has been very cautious about implying common law rules, 
constitutionalizing common law rules, because of words 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one way you can find it in the Constitution is that we have built a 
body of law about the obligation of people bringing 
prosecutions that wouldn't fit within your situation
 For -- what are the Brady -- what's the Brady obligation of your client? MR
 LONG: Well, if you will bear with me, I think the Constitution does answer questions like the 
Brady question, but it's not the penumbras and 
emanations of words like crimes
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What are the Brady obligations of your client? MR
 LONG: Well, I -- I think because the way -- the way this Court has defined criminal contempt 
does not look to the interest of the party versus the 
interest of the sovereign; in fact, the Court has said 
over and over again in Bagwell and Hicks and other cases 
that in all criminal contempt cases, civil and criminal,  
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what are the Brady obligations of your client? MR
 LONG: Due process says this is a criminal proceeding, Your Honor, if I can explain in a 
minute, and therefore, all the due process rights of a 
-- for a petty criminal offense apply
 And I would say JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your client has to provide the -- her husband a lawyer? Who has to provide a lawyer in this criminal contempt proceeding? MR
 LONG: D
C
 courts do provide lawyers if the -- to the defendant
 I mean a very important point here is these are often pro se cases, where the woman 
comes in to say -- or the petitioner; it's usually a 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know if you have answered the Chief's question
 He has asked to have a lawyer; is there a Brady obligation? What are the MR
 LONG: They -- they come from the Due Process Clause
 And if I could have just the Court's indulgence for one minute, I think the answer to a lot 
of these questions is not looking to penumbras and 
emanations from crimes, but looking at this Court's  
 decisions deciding what is criminal contempt and what is 
civil contempt
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But can we get to the Brady? That was one of the questions I had, too
 Let's say we have the -- we'll call it a private person as 
prosecuting
 MR
 LONG: Right
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: a right to look at all the government files to see if 
there is any exonerating evidence? MR
 LONG: JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, how does it work? That's what we want to know
 MR
 LONG: This is a determinate sentence, so under this Court's cases, without regard to whether 
the government's interests are -- take precedence over 
the private interests, it's criminal
 So you get all JUSTICE KENNEDY: But how does it work? Does -- does the -- does the person who is bringing this 
prosecution have the right to go in and -- and look at 
MR
 LONG: Well, right
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and that the prosecutor has? That's the only way Brady would work
  
 MR
 LONG: In this case the court said that the Brady rights did apply
 I mean, this is another reason why I would urge the Court not to try to decide a 
number of very important questions about a very 
important system that has not really been properly 
presented in D
C
 JUSTICE BREYER: What do we do about that? 
MR
 LONG: JUSTICE BREYER: -- without thinking about the one you don't
 MR
 LONG: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: And the reasons, as I have MR
 LONG: There are -- it may be that this is the wrong case
 JUSTICE BREYER: So what do --- so what do we do? I mean, I think of this as like Aeschylus; you have the Furies gradually giving way to justice
 MR
 LONG: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: MR
 LONG: JUSTICE BREYER: -- vengeance is out and justice is in, and we have , years of that, and they 
 are all going to be variations of that theme and we 
could think of  arguments
 Boasting
 Then is this special? MR
 LONG: JUSTICE BREYER: Well, before I can answer that question, I would like to know whether the 
government could appoint the private person
 After all there is a check -- there is a check against the total 
Furies, it's the government doing it
 Now you say no, the government can't do it, so -- but they can do it on 
their own
 Maybe -- I don't know
 MR
 LONG: JUSTICE BREYER: How do I get my -- how do I begin to answer these questions bound together in my 
mind in some partial way? MR
 LONG: Well, part -- part of the answer is, of course, that the court exercises control
 
Another part of the answer is that the D
C
 legislature, 
which is exercising delegated legislative authority from 
Congress, has determined that this is in the public 
interest
 And you know, the third part of it is that we are not granting these private individuals excessive 
authority
 JUSTICE BREYER: But you want to do that
  
 You see, so there is no control
 You are saying we want the private individuals to have the authority to bring 
criminal contempt; they are on their own; they decide 
it
 The government has nothing to say about this
 It's a totally private matter
 MR
 LONG: No, but -- but you know, D
C
 tried for over a decade to do this with public 
prosecutors, and there just were not enough resources
 
So what we are allowing here, if I could take it a JUSTICE SCALIA: Some problems have no answers
 I mean, that doesn't prove anything
 MR
 LONG: JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that Congress could -- could set up a private organization to expend 
Federal funds -- we are going to abolish the Department 
of Education
 And we are going to give its function to a private organization that will take care of all those 
things
 No good, right? MR
 LONG: Well, but there is a long, long tradition of having private individuals undertake 
prosecutions of crimes
 I mean, so what you're JUSTICE SCALIA: MR
 LONG: On behalf of
  
 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- on behalf of the executive
 You are looking for a section of the Constitution; I suggest Article II, Section , the 
executive power shall be vested in the President
 MR
 LONG: JUSTICE SCALIA: And just as the executive power includes the power to expend funds appropriated by 

in the instance of necessity acknowledged by Young, 
which I think was wrongly decided anyway -- except in 
that one narrow instance, the -- the power to prosecute 
belongs to the executive
 MR
 LONG: But -- but Justice Scalia, we are dealing with the District of Columbia
 The Constitution does not assign any powers over the District to the 
executive or to the judicial branch
 JUSTICE BREYER: All right
 Now the State of California, trying to save money, say we have a very 
good idea
 We are going to pass one law, abolish all the prosecutors' offices and say wherever there is a 
victim of crime, that victim will bring the prosecution
 
Now you really are back to the Furies
 Is that constitutional? MR
 LONG: Well -- and again, there is 
 abundant historical precedent for that
 JUSTICE BREYER: before Aeschylus
 Or whatever
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE BREYER: You would say that that is MR
 LONG: JUSTICE BREYER: -- to have a statute that all criminal prosecutions would be brought by victims, 
period? MR
 LONG: Well, I think there would be today serious due process problems to work through with 
that sort of system
 JUSTICE BREYER: All right
 If there are, then why aren't there the same here? MR
 LONG: Well, I would also say the Framers would have understood that to be a perfectly 
normal system
 They would not have thought it was 
were common at the time of the Framers
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I don't think that's right
 Private prosecutions were common at the time of the framing? You have got to go back a long way before they were common
 MR
 LONG: Well, I mean there -- that issue  
 is debated in the briefs and I think it was less common 
in the colonies in the United States than it was in 

as unconstitutional
 But this is -- now we are back to the question that I say really the Court should not decide 
because it was never properly -- whether this can be 
done by a private individual at all, even as the 
representative of the government
 So I don't think you should get into that
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure why -- how we can avoid it
 MR
 LONG: Well, you could wait for a case that presents it -- that properly presents it, where it 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, this case properly presents the argument that a private party can't bring a 
criminal prosecution on their -- in their own -- perhaps 
their own name, they can, but on their own, in their own 
interest
 It always has to be a government interest
 That's what the argument is
 MR
 LONG: Yes
 And that -- that is something that the Court we think could properly decide
 
 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are saying the answer to that is, no, they can bring a claim in their 
own name? MR
 LONG: Yes, we -- we are arguing two things
 They can bring it in their own name, that's not unconstitutional; and they can certainly -- they could 
certainly bring it as the representative of the 
government, that is also constitutional
 And -- and so JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no
 But the last question is the one that they are disputing; it can't be 
in their own interest
 MR
 LONG: Yes, absolutely
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you are saying it can
 MR
 LONG: Yes
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Answer why
 MR
 LONG: Because the D
C
 Council said they could do it
 So we have a legislature that has said that the interest of a private party here takes 
precedence, and that is not an unconstitutional 
determination by the legislature
 In this Court's criminal contempt cases, the Court has said we don't 
look to whose interest is paramount or what this -- the 
legislature or what the Court says whose interest is 
 paramount
 We recognize that both kinds of contempt, civil and criminal, further the sovereign's interest in 
vindicating the court's orders and further the private 
interest in seeing that that order which applies 
particularly to that party is followed
 So you don't look to that at all
 You just look to the nature of the punishment
 And if it's a determinate sentence versus a coercive sentence, then 
it's criminal
 So that answers all the questions about JUSTICE BREYER: you might say this
 To answer your question that is here, there are a couple of ways of doing this
 One way you would say is, well, don't worry about this so much
 
If the answer is no, you can still bring your private 
prosecution but you have got to get government 
permission, because you are doing it in the way of the 
government
 But if the answer to the question is if you can't do either, they you might say, then why wouldn't 
you say why well, aren't we back to the Eumenides, and 
the answer is going to be this is say contempt
 
Contempt is special
 I don't know whether either or both of those  
 ways would work
 So what would you think, since the government has changed its position, of sending this 
back so some of these things can be worked out? At least we would have some opinions that would help us
 MR
 LONG: Well, you know, I think that would be an unfortunate result in the sense that, you 
know, the plea agreement in our view doesn't prevent 
this prosecution on any reasonable interpretation
 You know, we also think for the reasons I have been trying 
to spell out that there is no real basis for the Court 
to hold that it is unconstitutional, only in the 
criminal contempt setting, for the D
C
 legislature to 
find that the private interest here justifies allowing 
the private party to bring this action but it's still 
criminal
 Because it's a determinate sentence, you get all the due process just as you would as -- if the 
government brought it
 You get all the due process rights which in fact the defendant did get here
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, unless you think it's a violation of due process for an interested 
party to be able to criminally prosecute someone at 
their -- at their discretion
 MR
 LONG: Well, and that -- and, you  
 JUSTICE SCALIA: You want to plea bargain with a -- with an interested party? MR
 LONG: Well, but Mr
 Chief Justice and Justice Scalia, I mean, this is a system that is in all 
the States
 It's not just domestic violence
 It's child custody
 It's child support
 The amicus briefs JUSTICE KENNEDY: Criminal -- criminal contempt prosecution or civil contempt prosecution? MR
 LONG: Well -- well, but -- yes
 Criminal contempt for violation of court orders about 
domestic violence, about child custody, about child 
support
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those are in every state? JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there can be order to show cause, but you are saying that every state 
allows a private person to have a criminal prosecution 
for criminal contempt? MR
 LONG: Well, the -- the amicus briefs at --  allow -- at this point,  allow you to file a 
motion
 These things are typically begun by motion, not a charging document
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, a -- a motion is different
 
 MR
 LONG: Yes
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: then the court decides based on the position of the 
MR
 LONG: Yes
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- whether or not to proceed
 And the court certainly can appoint a prosecutor, and does in many states
 MR
 LONG: Absolutely, Justice Kennedy
 And that's really what we're asking
 I mean, if you think about these situations, many thousands of cases, most of 
these individuals have no lawyers
 They are pro se
 A civil order is entered, about domestic violence, child 
custody, child support
 It's violated, or the individual thinks it's violated
 What do they do? They come to the court on their own, so now they are pro se, so now maybe we're in 
the Furies and Young and Province
 But this is -- to make the system work, we at least, I submit, have to 
allow those individuals to come to the court and file a 
motion, even though they are interested in, say, 
somebody's violating the order, Judge, you should do 
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well, that's a different matter
 
 MR
 LONG: No
 No
 No
 JUSTICE BREYER: That's -- that's -- why isn't it a different matter? MR
 LONG: I mean, that's what -- that's what happened in this case
 It so happens this woman was represented by the D
C
 Attorney General, who is a 
public prosecutor
 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so now you are into the question of what counts as a prosecution
 MR
 LONG: Yes, yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: And there again, I am at sea
 I don't know what the authority is
 MR
 LONG: Well, if I could -- if I can just do it step by step
 I mean, in this case and in tens of thousands of other cases, the first step is just 
allowing that motion to be filed
 And if you don't allow that, you say that's unconstitutional, the entire 
system will -- will blow up
 So if you at least get to that, then we say, well -- the judge looks at it and says, well, civil's 
not appropriate here because the violation is over; if I 
am going to punish this, it's going to have to be a 
determinant sentence, that's criminal
 At that point, under this Court's cases, due process requires all sorts 
of things to protect the defendant
 
 He gets a lawyer, or the other -- now, it would say, you don't have -- the Constitution doesn't 
require that there be a lawyer appointed to prosecute 
every one of these, or that would be my submission
 So let the individual come in and file a motion
 Let the court come in and look at it
 Don't require a prosecutor to be appointed, interested or disinterested
 
And then at that point, if the Court is exercising 
sufficient control over this, to say if -- if the 
person, the woman, happens to have that lawyer, that 
lawyer has to just stand aside and can't play any 
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the situation here in D
C
? When the woman comes in, can the judge look it over and say, Ah, you don't have anything here; I'm not 
going to -- I'm not going to allow you to go ahead
 MR
 LONG: Well, you know, we have no record JUSTICE SCALIA: how does the statute read? As I understand it, it's not up to the judge to decide whether there is enough there 
to allow her to go forward or to appoint somebody on his 
own
 She is the prosecutor
 It's up to her whether MR
 LONG: The way the statute and the court 
 rules read is you file a motion, not an indictment or an 
information, a motion to hold the person in contempt
 As I understand it, it is set down for a hearing
 I mean, that's sort of the way the family court works
 So they will have a hearing and the judge JUSTICE SCALIA: A hearing on whether she can prosecute or a hearing on -- on whether he's going 
to be guilty or not
 MR
 LONG: You know, I am very uncomfortable to spend -- I have gone and observed one of these and 
I've talked to one of the judges, but none of this is in 
the record, Justice Scalia
 I mean, I think what they typically do is try to figure out what it's about, 
whether it's civil or criminal
 If it's criminal, they would appoint a lawyer for the defendant and then they 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But can your private prosecutor, however you want to describe her, could she 
enter into a plea agreement with the defendant? MR
 LONG: Well, they can -- they can agree to withdraw
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, she said you could be subject to you  days; I will agree, and 
you'll plead guilty to  days
  
 MR
 LONG: Again, none of this is in the record
 My understanding is, that doesn't happen, although I am honestly not sure
 I think it would be up JUSTICE SCALIA: Or pay $, to your victim, which is me
 MR
 LONG: Well, you know, I have no information about whether that sort of thing happens or 
how the Court would treat it
 But I think my basic point is, you know, this is a very important system, not 
just to the District of Columbia, but to the whole 
country
 JUSTICE BREYER: MR
 LONG: And the details matter
 And to change it to a system where we now say there have to 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But a specific country -- this is the point Justice Scalia was 
making -- the rest of the country, it's a state system
 MR
 LONG: Well, but -- but D
C
, Your JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: MR
 LONG: -- is like a state in the sense JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
 that's the question
 That's the question that I don't know that we have enough information in the record 
about
 Is this really -- is this prosecution like a state? That's the Solicitor General's position, which is, it's on behalf of the local government, not on the 
behalf of the Federal government as a sovereign
 I think that's what this case speaks to
 MR
 LONG: If you look at them -- if you look at this Court's decision in Palmore
 I mean, we are dealing with an Article I court of the District of 
Columbia, not an Article III court, to the extent that 
the sovereign's interest is at stake here
 Let's keep the interest of that Article I court
 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there somewhere I can look to see what happens? All I can find in the long law is that a violation of the order is a contempt
 
Fine; no problem
 And then the only word about the Petitioner, it says the Petitioner is entitled to relief 
under this chapter, which contains about  different 
things
 And it doesn't say what kind of relief
 It doesn't say how you get relief
 It doesn't say if you are just asking -- all those things you raised
 So how do I find out actually what is in the system
 MR
 LONG: You mean the relief for contempt? JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say that
 It  
 says the earlier part of this statute which goes on for 
six pages in an earlier part of this statue, which goes 
on for six pages, seven pages
 It says, a Petitioner has a right to seek relief under this subchapter
 Now, that contains civil contempt
 It contains how you get protective orders
 It contains a lot of things that are absolutely noncontroversial
 So I am trying to figure out: What is the system? MR
 LONG: Well, I think -- I think the honest answer is, Justice Breyer, you can find some of 
these things by looking around, but since we've been 
talking about issues that were not properly litigated 
and not decided and we do not have a well-developed 
record, some of these things are just not going to be 
available
 And again, we think -- you know, this case started out about a plea agreement
 It's really a small case
 We are now talking about these great big issues
 We think the plea agreement doesn't bar this under any 
reasonable construction, and so the right result is 
either to dismiss the cases as improvidentally granted 
or to affirm
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 General Kagan
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELENA KAGAN  
 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT GENERAL KAGAN: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are two questions, properly raised, in this case
 Petitioner is right about one
 Respondent is right about the other and the disposition
 There are a couple of questions that are extremely interesting --
I can see why the Court is interested in them -- but 
were not properly raised in this case, and this Court 
should not decide them
 What Petitioner is right about is that in this criminal contempt action, Ms
 Watson, the 
Respondent, was and must have been exercising sovereign 
power, that she was acting as a state actor for purposes 
of the Constitution
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Whose state power was she acting on behalf of? GENERAL KAGAN: The way we understand this, Justice Sotomayor, is that Respondent was exercising 
sovereign power on behalf of the Article I court, the D
C
 court, which of course is partly a local court, but is exercising power whose initial source, original 
source, is Congress
 
 So she is exercising sovereign power in order to vindicate the Court's order, the order of -- of 
restraint
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Courts don't have the power to incarcerate people
 I mean, if you are prosecuting for a criminal offense, you are exercising more than the 
power of the Court
 GENERAL KAGAN: I -- I don't believe that is the case, Justice Scalia
 Imagine Respondent essentially doing the same function that an appointed 
person would do in Young
 There, of course, the court appointed the person to prosecute contempt
 Here Respondent is essentially doing the same thing, is 
acting in order to prosecute a contempt on the court and 
JUSTICE SCALIA: But nobody asserted in Young that the prosecutor appointed by the court was 
only exercising the power of the court
 Surely it was the power of the government that the -- that the 
prosecutor was exercising
 Now, the court was given the power to appoint that prosecutor, but I would think it's 
extraordinary to say that there's nothing but the 
court's power in play
 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, the court is surely part of the government, and in the end this is power of 
 the United States
 The court is created through power of the United States
 It's an Article I court
 And so Respondent is no doubt exercising sovereign power and 
exercising it on behalf of the United States ultimately
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Then why doesn't an agreement by the United States not to prosecute carry 
the day? GENERAL KAGAN: Yes, so this goes to the second question, in which I think Respondent is right
 
And the reason is that when a single U
S
 Attorney's 
Office says that the government will decide to drop a 
certain set of charges, that U
S
 Attorney's Office we 
believe is -- is speaking for itself, unless there is 
some indication that it is speaking more widely in such 
a way that will bind other parts of the government
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's -- that's absolutely startling
 The different U
S
 Attorneys all work for your boss, right? They work for the Attorney General
 How can one part of the Attorney General agree to something that doesn't bind the other part of the 
Attorney General? GENERAL KAGAN: The United States Government CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take your word for it
  
 (Laughter
) GENERAL KAGAN: -- and the fact that the Southern District of New York agrees to do one thing 
does not bind, for example, the INS, does not 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe or maybe not, but surely it binds the New Jersey U
S
 Attorney
 If you -- just think about it
 The -- the U
S
 Attorney from the Southern District says: Look, you agree to go to jail for  years and I will drop these  charges
 
Done
 Then the U
S
 Attorney for New Jersey can come in and prosecute under those three charges? GENERAL KAGAN: Assuming that the U
S
 Attorney in the second office has jurisdiction and 
assuming that the plea agreement does not say anything 
to suggest that it should be read more broadly, I think 
the answer is yes
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do you get -- I mean, you are a defendant
 You have to go to all more than , all the U
S
 Attorney's Offices and 
say, will you agree to this and get everybody to sign 
off? GENERAL KAGAN: Well, Mr
 Chief Justice, even if you are right I think that we prevail
 There are two views in the court system
 One is the Second 
 and Seventh Circuit and they take the position that I've 
taken, which is that the default position is that the 
contracting party binds only the contracting party and 
that the plea agreement needs to say something in order 
to apply more broadly
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It can't do that
 If the U
S
 attorney in New Jersey has the authority to 
prosecute this, the U
S
 Attorney in New York can't say, 
oh, and by the way I bind all the other U
S
 Attorneys
 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, the U
S
 Attorney in New York could -- presumably that U
S
 Attorney will 
know who else might have jurisdiction over the 
underlying conduct and would go and get an agreement 
from those other U
S
 attorneys
 But unless the U
S
 Attorney does that, under one approach the agreement 
bars only the contracting entity
 But even if you're JUSTICE STEVENS: But do I understand your position that in this particular case the U
S
 Attorney 
could have entered into a settlement agreement that 
would have bound the Respondent? GENERAL KAGAN: We actually don't think that that's right, Justice Stevens
 We think that in fact the U
S
 Attorney did not bind the Respondent, but we 
don't think it could have bound the Respondent, and it  
 goes back to my answer to Justice Sotomayor, because 
Respondent here is representing the D
C
 court system
 
JUSTICE STEVENS: You draw a distinction between the D
C
 Circuit -- the D
C
 and the United 
States? GENERAL KAGAN: Yes
 Ultimately the D
C
 court system is an actor that is wielding United States 
authority
 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you would agree, I take it, that the attorney for the District of Columbia 
could have bound Respondent? Somebody could bind Respondent without Respondent even knowing about it, 
that's what I'm asking
 GENERAL KAGAN: I think only the D
C
 court could have prevented Respondent from going forward
 I JUSTICE SCALIA: And I have to agree with you that to accept this argument that the prosecutor 
here is an agent just of the court, just of the D
C
 
court, not an agent of the executive? GENERAL KAGAN: If -- who would you like the person be an agent of, Justice Scalia? (Laughter
) JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not making the  
 argument
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Usually we have questions the other way
 GENERAL KAGAN: I apologize
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know that courts have ever asserted that they themselves have the power 
to prosecute
 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, I do think that that's the situation that we find in Young, where a court 
appoints a person to prosecute a contempt on behalf of 
the court
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not on behalf of the court
 On behalf of the government, and that's why Young said 
you should offer it first to the United States Attorney, 
and only if he won't bring it, then you can appoint 
somebody else to bring it
 But the -- the prosecutor is not the court
 My God
 What a terrible situation
 The prosecutor's the court, the judge is the court? GENERAL KAGAN: Well, I do think Young is different, Justice Scalia, because Young was a 
separation of powers case
 This case is not because it arises in D
C
 In Young, absolutely the judge has to go to the U
S
 Attorney's Office first
 But that's not the case here, because normal separation of powers 
principles are not in application in D
C
  
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't it the case that only the U
S
 Attorney can prosecute for this crime? Could the D
C
 attorney general or whatever the name of it, 
what, counsel, prosecute for this felony? GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Scalia, I don't believe that is entirely clear
 I think that the court could ask the D
C
 Attorney General to prosecute the 
crime in the same way that the court in Young asked the U
S
 Attorney's Office
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because it's all up to the court; the court's the big prosecutor, right? GENERAL KAGAN: Well, just as -- I know you dissented in Young, Justice Scalia
 But just as the court in Young goes to the U
S
 Attorney first and when 
the court is told no the court can appoint its own 
independent prosecutor, essentially that's what is 
happening here
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if there were a finding of innocent, or not guilty, by this prosecutor, 
could the official prosecutor then prosecute again, or 
would there be double jeopardy? If you are saying they are somehow separate, does the double jeopardy clause 
apply? GENERAL KAGAN: Well, this Court held in Dixon that the double jeopardy clause does apply, 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that was the same authority
 GENERAL KAGAN: Yes, and they all are exercising power from the United States
 Dixon involved this very statute
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you don't think this is a Bartkiss-like case, like Bartkiss v
 Illinois? GENERAL KAGAN: I -- I am not familiar with that case, Justice Kennedy, but I do think that the 
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That a State prosecution doesn't bar a later Federal prosecution
 GENERAL KAGAN: Yes, that's exactly right, because ultimately all of these power are exercising 
power that comes from the same source, which is the 
United States Government
 JUSTICE BREYER: Is your argument the broad argument that the Chief Justice was talking about, that 
we have a man who drives in a car from Baltimore to rob 
a bank in Washington and the U
S
 Attorney in Washington 
gives him a piece of paper which says, I will not 
prosecute you for this now or in the future, and 
suddenly the U
S
 Attorney in Baltimore prosecutes it
 
Are you saying that that is barred or not barred?  
 That's the broad argument
 GENERAL KAGAN: JUSTICE BREYER: Or are you making a narrow argument? GENERAL KAGAN: Under several circuits' JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm just asking you your position on that
 Can the -- does this piece of paper from the U
S
 Attorney in Washington bar 
prosecution by the U
S
 attorney in Baltimore? Yes or no? GENERAL KAGAN: I have a principal position and I have a back-up position
 My principal position is yes, it does, for the reason that I gave to the Chief 
Justice
 JUSTICE BREYER: It does bar? GENERAL KAGAN: It does
 The full rule is that the bar is only as to the office that -- that 
executes the agreement
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, could I ask you could a  or I guess Bivens action be brought 
against Ms
 Watson? The defendant, you know, it turns out he's not guilty and he thinks there was malice
 
Could he bring a Bivens action against her? GENERAL KAGAN: Mr
 Chief Justice, I have  
 not thought about that question
 I am completely clear as to your -- the question that you asked to Mr
 Long, 
which is does she have Brady obligations
 She does have Brady obligations
 She was held to Brady obligations
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: She's a State actor
 She's acting on behalf either of the United States or 
the District of Columbia
 Therefore, she can be sued directly and be personally liable
 GENERAL KAGAN: She -- it is absolutely right that she is a State actor for constitutional 
purposes
 And she was treated as such throughout this litigation
 To go back to Justice Breyer's point -- may I? CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, briefly
 GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Breyer's question, the Chief Justice's question: Even circuits that apply a default rule whereby the government is the entire 
government and there needs to be limiting things in the 
agreement, I think if you look at this agreement you 
will find those limiting things, both in the cross-outs 
in the caption and in the particular promises that the 
United States Government has made, which applies really 
only to the United States Attorney's Office
 Thank you, Mr
 Chief Justice
  
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General
 Ms
 Frankfurt, you have  minutes remaining
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JACLYN S
 FRANKFURT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MS
 FRANKFURT: Thank you
 I just want to say in response both to -- to Mr
 Long's comments, that a lack record as to what 
actually occurred or the general comment, about whether 
or not Ms
 Watson was treated as a State actor --I actually think there is a -- a decent record in this 
case that what occurred was not a motion to request the 
court to issue a show cause, but in fact, a -- a motion 
that requested -- that triggered a ministerial act, 
which was an act -- which was used as a charging 
document, which the judge believed she had no 
discretion, and the Assistant Attorney General, who was 
representing the Petitioner, believed she had no 
discretion to control, and Ms
 Watson was treated as 
bringing the action on her own behalf
 That's what the lower court held as a factual matter, and I think it is quite supported by the 
record
 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this: The District of Columbia Court of Appeals said we are 
satisfied that no objectively reasonable person could 
 understand that Mr
 Robertson's plea agreement bound 
Ms
 Watson and precluded her contempt proceeding against 
Mr
 Robertson
 If we accept that, is there any other issue in this case? MS
 FRANKFURT: If you -- yes
 The issue is whether she could constitutionally bring the case on her 
own
 JUSTICE ALITO: And did you preserve that? If -- if Mr
 -- Mr
 Robertson had said, I understand 
this only means that I am not going to be charged with a 
-- a criminal offense by the United States Attorney's 
Office for the District of Columbia, and it has no 
application to this civil contempt proceeding
 MS
 FRANKFURT: We absolutely raise that because our argument from -- from the very beginning was 
she can't constitutionally be representing herself in 
this proceeding
 If this is happening constitutionally, she represents the United States, and if she represents 
the United States, then our plea agreement bars it 
because our plea agreement was with the government
 It indicated the government will not -- will JUSTICE ALITO: But that's a separate question
 So the first question is: What was agreed to under the plea agreement, right?  
 MS
 FRANKFURT: Yes, and at the time that we signed the plea agreement, there was no precedent for 
the notion of a private person bringing a criminal 
action in her own name, interest and on her own behalf
 
No one would have contemplated that such a thing was 
constitutional, because you know, back until appeals of 
JUSTICE ALITO: Just so I understand what is before us, you preserve -- you saying -- you are saying 
you preserve the issue that even if your client fully 
understood that this plea agreement had no application 
to a criminal contempt proceeding, he preserved the 
argument that he could contest the criminal contempt 
proceeding on the ground that it would be 
unconstitutional? MS
 FRANKFURT: I'm sorry
 I am not -- I am not sure that I'm understanding, or that my words 
haven't been misinterpreted
that the reasonable interpretation of that plea 
agreement was that it wouldn't apply to a criminal 
contempt proceeding
 JUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand that
 I understand there's the contract issue
 in the lower court, did you argue even if he gave that 
 up, under the plea agreement, the criminal contempt 
proceeding still could not be brought? MS
 FRANKFURT: Even if he gave up the right of a private person to prosecute on her own behalf? Any JUSTICE ALITO: Even if he didn't get that -- a bar to that under the plea agreement, the contempt 
proceeding would still be barred for some other reason? 
Did you make that argument? MS
 FRANKFURT: I am not sure that I can answer that we did, because I am not sure that I -- I 
understand the question
 I -- I know that we did make the argument that it could only have lawfully been 
brought on behalf of the sovereign, and that the 
sovereign was the United States
 And so our view was if this Court views it the way the lower court did, which 
was as an action between private parties, then it's 
unconstitutional under Gompers
 JUSTICE SCALIA: You did raise, undoubtedly you say, the point that the only way in which she could 
be the prosecutor was as an agent of the United States? MS
 FRANKFURT: Absolutely
 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that it was unconstitutional for her to -- to represent herself
 MS
 FRANKFURT: Absolutely
 I think we  
 Sotomayor
 One is that there was no formula before
 There was some general guidance that was given in the 
statute
 It's much like the proposition of good faith
 Good faith is almost incapable of definition, yet every 
circuit in the United States has a laundry list of 
factors that are taken into account for good faith
 Here, reasonable and necessary expenses under the old law had a few suggestions as to what 
needed to be involved with them
 Now we have a portion of another part of the triangle, which is under (b)
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in a sense that cuts against you
 As I was -- when I was reading your opening brief, it seemed to me the tone was, well, if 
you accept the Respondent's position Congress did 
nothing at all
 Well, they did do something very important
 They had a formula for disposable income
 The question is, does that formula apply to projected? 
Can that formula be modified altered or projected for 
projected? So it's not as if Congress did nothing or it's not as if the amendment accomplishes nothing even 
under the Respondent's view
 It accomplished something very important
 MR
 HAMILTON: My answer, Justice Kennedy, is that the definition of the word, quote, "projected," 
end of quote, has -- there's never has been one in the  
 code
 That was a term that was in the  code and is carried over into the present code
 How it was applied is vastly different
 The dispute under the prior law was over whether or not the 
court could take into account changes in circumstances 
which were likely to occur post-confirmation
 And so we had cases like the Anderson v
 Satterlee case out of the 
Ninth Circuit and the Midkiff case out of the Tenth 
Circuit that disagreed as to how that ought to be 
applied
 In the Anderson v
 Satterlee case the Chapter  trustee requested that the debtor sign 
essentially a pledge that they would devote their excess 
income to the plan, and the Anderson court said: Wait a minute; there is another statute at issue here and that 
is 
  allows for the modification of the plan after the plan has been confirmed
 Prior to the confirmation of the plan, the debtor still has the 
ability -- and this ties in with some of the comments 
made by Justice Alito -- the debtor still has the 
ability to amend the plan under 
 So all of these statutes need to be read together to show what the result is
 Now the question is not whether or not changes should be taken into 
account for post-confirmation that may be likely to  
 occur, but whether or not the court may deviate from the 
statute where Congress has said this is how we want you 
to determine current monthly income, therefore 
disposable income and consequently projected disposable 
income
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you already told us that there could be a deviation through this 
(A)(ii)
 And why, if that was all that needed to be done, did the trustee recommend, did the trustee say, 
bankruptcy judge, let's move the period, let's use this 
provision and we will get another period that doesn't 
have those  months with the extraordinary income? MR
 HAMILTON: No, Justice Ginsburg, and the reason is, is that that privilege is accorded only to 
the debtor to move that -month period
 Neither the unsecured creditors nor the trustee have the ability to 
request that that -month period be moved
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it could have been suggested to the debtor: You can accomplish what you want by using this provision
 MR
 HAMILTON: The record is silent as to whether or not that occurred
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- where can you move it? I don't really -- this is the same line of inquiry as Justice Ginsburg
 What's the -- what has to be the  
 
much beyond the date of what, the hearing? MR
 HAMILTON: It would be up to confirmation, but the confirmation hearing could be 
continued as the court saw fit
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The review of the determination or the request to move the period is -- is 
what? Up to the total discretion of the -- of the judge? MR
 HAMILTON: It appears to be so under the statute, Chief Justice Roberts
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your objection to the fact that the judge has more discretion with respect 
to defining "projected disposable" -- you don't mind the 
discretion on the other side
 MR
 HAMILTON: No, Your Honor, I don't believe the discretion is not in determining the income, 
only in determining the time period
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, but the only purpose of moving the time period is to change the 
income
 MR
 HAMILTON: That's true
 And there are other options that the debtor had available in addition 
to that, that we have referred to as the four options, 
which would be the debtor could have here just delayed  
 filing the case for a couple of months and these 
problems would not have occurred
 JUSTICE SCALIA: There is another discretion that you don't seem to object to
 one way the debtor can get out of the bind that he's put 
in by the fixing of the confirmed plan is simply to move 
for a revision of the confirmed plan
 MR
 HAMILTON: Absolutely, Justice Scalia
 JUSTICE SCALIA: What constrains the judge in allowing or not allowing the revision? Doesn't he have the same kind of discretion with regard to the 
revision that you're objecting to with regard to his 
establishing the payments? MR
 HAMILTON: Justice Scalia, I don't think so
  has been subject to quite a bit of litigation, but the argument that we make in our reply brief is that 
it would be simply necessary to plug in and plug out 
whatever the change in circumstance is
 So the debtor would be able to say, my wife's income is now gone, so we want to take that out 
of the formula
 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's the same thing that's being argued here, that -- that you start with 
the fixed calculation based on the  months before and 
then you have to show that there were some extraordinary  
 circumstances that justify a change
 I don't see that there's any difference
 MR
 HAMILTON: There may not be, except that there is a statutory requirement as to how that is 
accomplished and that's where the (A)(ii) comes 
into play
 It's not so much that there is a problem JUSTICE SCALIA: What your case comes down to is the bankruptcy court can do this, but it has to do 
it by simply revising the plan, not by establishing the 
plan initially but by revising it
 MR
 HAMILTON: Not necessarily, Your Honor
 That certainly is one way
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe? MR
 HAMILTON: It may be, yes
 It depends on the facts of the case
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's a good answer, isn't it, because your point would be the 
statute does not allow that exercise of discretion with 
respect to projected disposable income, but it does in 
the other areas
 MR
 HAMILTON: Well, again I respectfully disagree, Chief Justice Roberts
 JUSTICE SCALIA: That was a friendly question
  
 MR
 HAMILTON: I'm sorry? I'm sorry, I didn't hear
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, my -- my point and what I thought your point would be is that the fact 
that there is exercise of discretion in two different 
areas is not the problem
 The problem is that in one area the discretion is specifically permitted and in the 
other area, projected disposable income, it's not
 MR
 HAMILTON: I agree
 (Laughter
 ) JUSTICE ALITO: But can the -- can the plan be modified based on -- can the plan be modified based 
on something that was known before the plan was 
confirmed? MR
 HAMILTON: That depends on which jurisdiction one would be in, Justice Alito
 The most JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if it can't, then how is this modification remedy going to work? MR
 HAMILTON: I think it should be
 For example, a good example of this would be debtor is 
expected  years from now to no longer have to repay a 
(k) loan
 And so one view would be that you ought to take that into account as of that date and figure those 
calculations, which becomes extremely unwieldy
 You are 
 guessing at that point
 The debtor may say: Well, I may be losing that, but I don't know what my actual 
circumstances are going to be  years from now
 Chapter  is a fluid process
 JUSTICE ALITO: Your argument is that the Court has to confirm a plan that is really not 
confirmable because the debtor can't possibly make the 
payments under the plan, but then can turn around 
immediately and modify the plan so that it does call for 
payments to be made
 MR
 HAMILTON: No, Your Honor
 That is not my argument
 JUSTICE ALITO: explain it, then? MR
 HAMILTON: Well, what we are saying is that this plan cannot be confirmed as it stands because 
the debtor would have to be able to make those payments 
and the debtor obviously is not capable of making those 
payments
 But it's because she chose the wrong options
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But let me just stop you there, because then the answer you gave to the Chief and 
to Justice Scalia doesn't fit
 the bankruptcy judge is not going to confirm the plan 
was she has to pay over $, a month, because she  
 could never do that
 So you are not going to get that confirmed plan which could be amended later
 MR
 HAMILTON: Well, I agreed with that
 I may have misunderstood the question that I was asked
 
But what I'm saying is that the statute needs to be 
followed and if the debtor had followed the statutes 
here then the debtor likely could have obtained a 
confirmed plan by moving that -month time frame
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what in addition to -- you brought up the  solution that she doesn't do 
what the statute tells her to do, so she's able to move 
it if the judge agrees
 And you said she has other options
 MR
 HAMILTON: Yes
 Well, the other options -- and I referred to them as the four options and the 
(A)(ii) is one of those options
 As I said, she could have delayed filing the case
 There is nothing in the schedules that would indicate that she was filing 
this bankruptcy under exigent circumstances
 There is no foreclosure, there is no repossession, there's no 
garnishment, there's no lawsuit
 So delay would have been a possible, and a debtor is always able to 
determine the date of the filing of the petition
 The second thing that she could have done is file a Chapter , and this is the anomaly between  
 Chapter  and Chapter , is that she would have 
qualified in all likelihood for a discharge under 
Chapter  because she would have met the special 
circumstances test in (b)
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then the creditors would have been a lot worse off, would they not have 
been? MR
 HAMILTON: That's very possible, but it's a formula that Congress thought to place into 
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why would -- why would the trustee be urging the possibility that it 
would be okay for her to file under Chapter , in which 
case the unsecured creditors would get very little, but 
it's not okay for her to use chapter  with a plan that 
would give the unsecured creditors substantial payments? MR
 HAMILTON: Here, Justice Ginsburg, the reason is plain and simple, and that was I sought to 
enforce the rule of law in order to have the courts 
determine how the rules were supposed to be interpreted
 
By my view, it seemed like that had she followed the 
rules maybe she would have gotten there, but the way she 
did it she can't
 It's kind of like driving a car
 You can't expect that a the car is going to perform well if 
you don't turn the engine on
  
 JUSTICE SCALIA: MR
 HAMILTON: And here she didn't turn the engine on
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I come back to Justice Ginsburg's question about whether there would 
ever be the opportunity to adjust the confirmed plan? 
Because as you say, the plan here would not have been 
confirmed, but that -- that isn't the case always
 I mean, in many cases a plan would be confirmed because 
the -- the bankrupt could -- could barely make the 
payments that it requires; and then when it -- it is 
clear that, because of the extraordinary event in the 
preceding  months, the bankrupt is -- is not going to 
have that -- that amount of money, there would be the 
opportunity to adjust
 MR
 HAMILTON: Maybe not -- I'm sorry
 JUSTICE SCALIA: In other words, is your response to Justice Ginsburg "always," that it will 
always be the case that where there would be an 
adjustment under this theory, there would not have been 
a confirmation in the first place? MR
 HAMILTON: If the plan is not confirmable by an analysis of Schedules I and J, which 
are the income and expenses statutes, I am not going to 
recommend confirmation, and nor do I think any trustee 
 would
 Any events that are in the equation before the date of confirmation would likely be then subject to 
, the res judicata provisions of chapter 
 So if the plan is confirmed, say in Stephanie Lanning's case, 
with these facts known, then she would not be able to 
come in afterwards and ask for the court to modify under 
 because that's part of the confirmation order
 The other options that were available -- we discussed briefly the ability to file this as a Chapter 
 She also could have converted this case to a Chapter  post-petition with the same result, or she could have 
dismissed this case and refiled
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't that -- wouldn't that amount to just a -- a waste of everybody's time, to 
dismiss it and then refile it, and then she gets a time 
period that doesn't -- why -- why not just drop out 
those  months that are not representative of her 
income? MR
 HAMILTON: Because, Justice Ginsburg, the statute does not permit that
 It's not within the formula, and that's the question: Is the formula binding or is it not binding? If it is binding then this -- obviously
 Congress intended a more rule-bound statute
 It got that
 It was obvious that it intended to reduce judicial discretion, and the statute seems to  
 accomplish that
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the thing is -- but you have explained, your number one solution for her is 
this  route, which is -- gives lots of discretion in 
the court
 MR
 HAMILTON: Only in moving the -month period, Justice Ginsburg
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes
 MR
 HAMILTON: That would be the only discretion that the statute would appear to accord to 
the court
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that, by the way, the provision that allows it to move the 
-month period? MR
 HAMILTON: It's in (A) and it provides that the term "current monthly income" means 
the average monthly income from all sources that the 
debtor receives, or in a joint case the debtor and the 
debtor's spouse receive, without regard to whether such 
income is taxable income derived during the -month 
period ending on -- and then we come to subsections (i), 
little (i) -- or (ii)
 And those are -- that's the disjuncture; it's the -month period prior or some other 
time frame, and the language is important
 JUSTICE ALITO: What do you say about cases  
 in which moving the -month period can't solve the 
problem? For example, if the debtor had good income for many years going back, but then slight -- shortly before 
the filing of the plan loses his or her job, and there 
is no prospect that the debtor is going to get another 
job? Or it could be the converse, has very low income for a long period and then right before gets a job
 So you are not going to be able to cure those problems by 
moving the -month period
 What do you do then? MR
 HAMILTON: Well, Justice Alito, I think I would tie in  with respect to the first 
proposition, and that is if the debtor's circumstances 
have markedly changed, then the debtor has the ability 
to file an amended plan; and that amended plan could ask 
the court to move that time frame forward to a 
confirmation hearing that would take into account the 
drop in income
 With respect to the second part of your proposition, and that is an increase in income, then I 
as Chapter  trustee would have the ability to object 
to it on the basis of -- of good faith under either 
(a)() or (a)(), either the plan or the filing 
of the case itself
 And those -- the filing of the (a)() was the primary way in which all of these 
disputes were resolved before the  amendments which  
 brought in subsection (b) to  which introduced the 
concept of disposable income
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you file an amended plan and have the court restart the clock, when 
(A) says only if the debtor has not filed a 
schedule of current income? If there's been a plan confirmed or a plan proposed, then the income schedule 
had to have been filed
 MR
 HAMILTON: JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't do one without the other
 MR
 HAMILTON: Those are two different propositions, Your Honor
 One is if the plan is confirmed and one if it is not confirmed
 If it is not confirmed, then you are correct; at some point the 
trustee and the court are going to want to see a 
Schedule I and J to see what the actual income and 
expenses are
 If the plan has already been confirmed, then the ability to change the plan has to be done under 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Forget about 
 I'm going to the situation where the plan has been proposed, 
let's say
 The courts -- if a schedule of income has been filed, then it's without any jurisdiction to change 
the -month lookback period, correct?  
 MR
 HAMILTON: I don't agree with the word "jurisdiction," Justice Sotomayor
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it can't under (A)
 MR
 HAMILTON: The debtor would certainly have the ability to ask the court to be excused from 
that requirement given a change in circumstances
 But again it would be the formula that would be honored, 
rather than the court substituting judicial discretion
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask -- yes, there is one more question
 MR
 HAMILTON: Okay
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask whether , which you have now invoked, does not provide the same 
kind of discretion to the court that you are objecting 
to? What -- what standards are there for granting or not granting modification of the plan? Is it pretty much up to the judge? MR
 HAMILTON: No
 I believe again the court is bound, Justice Scalia, by the (A) formula
 
It's obvious that Congress intended the formula
 It would not make much sense to read the statute to have 
some other formula
 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then -- okay
 You are between a rock and a hard place
 Either  gets you out of that formula, which is what you've said, 
it's one way out, or it isn't
 Which is it? MR
 HAMILTON: I haven't said that it gets me out of the formula
 It gets me out of the time frame issue, because certainly the statute doesn't take into 
specific account what happens if the debtor loses a job, 
say, post-petition? Obviously -- example, husband loses the job at Goodyear after the bankruptcy petition is 
filed
 And I think  is broad enough to allow an amendment which would involve only moving the time 
frame
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay
 So any -- any MR
 HAMILTON: I believe so, Justice Scalia
 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- subsequent to the filing
 MR
 HAMILTON: If there are no other questions I would like to reserve the remainder of my 
time, Chief Justice Roberts
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 Mr
 Goldstein
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C
 GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR
 GOLDSTEIN: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court, I think, has the parties' arguments very well in hand
 I think the -- the one point that I can hopefully address, and it is I think 
the hardest part of our case, is to address the issue 
that Justice Alito raised, and that is, is there an 
anomaly in the fact that in BAPCPA Congress added the 
-month period, which would suggest perhaps that 
Congress was trying to lock in a particular period that 
we would look at
 And the answer to that question is no, and I want to take you to the relevant statutory provisions
 
Everything is going to be in the cert petition
 I am going to start in the petition appendix at , which is 
, which is the operative provision here
 And (b)() tells us that if the trustee or a creditor 
objects, then as of the effective date of the plan it's 
only going to be confirmed in subsection (b), which is 
the third full paragraph on page  is going to control
 The plan has to provide that all of the debtor's projected disposable income to be received in 
the applicable commitment period beginning on the date 
the first payment is due under the plan will be applied 
to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan
 
 And the thing to note first about that provision is that it, too, sets a timetable
 It's not just projected disposable income, but it's projected 
disposable income of a very particular type, to be 
received in the applicable commitment period
 So unless there is something particularly strange about the 
definition of "disposable income," Congress specified a 
period that the income is going to be measured in, and 
that's over the course of the plan; the word "projected" 
tells us to get a realistic estimation of what that 
amount of money's going to be
 Now, my friend makes the point that disposable income after BAPCPA is a defined term; the 
definition comes in the next paragraph; it's subsection 
(), (b)()
 For purposes of this subsection the term "disposable income" means current monthly income 
received by the debtor subject to some deductions and 
then the expenses
 So then we have to go to the definition of "current monthly income
" Current monthly income is in ; it's at page 
 That's where we get the -month period
 And it tells us that current monthly income is the average 
monthly income from all sources, so it's very 
encompassing, without regard to whether such income is 
taxable income derived during the -month period
 
 So, my friend's argument is that, well, Congress said  months
 The answer to that point is a couple fold
 First, as was suggested in the first half-hour, Congress was addressing a very specific 
problem there
 Before BAPCPA courts didn't know what the -- didn't agree on what the baseline was for 
determining someone's income
 Some courts would say, all right, you are a Chapter  debtor, right away I'm going to look at the 
latest month
 Some courts said  months
 We have a court in our brief that said  years
 So, we have to have a starting point to project from
 But the second point is that this term "current monthly income" isn't principally a Chapter  
term at all
 So, my friend's argument is that Congress stuck this -month period into Chapter , so it would 
be very anomalous if we could just -- in effect, he says 
we are throwing it out, we are giving the district 
judges discretion
 It's not quite right
 The place to look is in section , which is two pages later
  is a Chapter  provision
 And my friend started out by saying the problem with our 
position is that we were not following the Chapter  
means test
 That's the key
 borrowed from Chapter 
 So (b)()(A)(i) is at the 
 beginning of page  of the appendix
 And, so, we are in a Chapter  case here
 And this is the means test
 It tells us that: "In considering under paragraph ," so we are trying to 
figure out if there is a presumption of abuse under 
Chapter  -- "whether the granting of relief would be an 
abuse of the provisions of this chapter, the court shall 
presume abuse exists if the debtor's current monthly 
income, reduced by the amounts determined under clauses 
, , and " -- those are expense clauses -- "and 
multiplied by  is not less than" a certain amount
 So what happened is Congress in BAPCPA created this presumption of abuse in Chapter  and it 
then borrowed that concept, as my friend pointed out, in 
Chapter 
 So that -month period has real force and effect in the Bankruptcy Code in Chapter 
 So it's not like Congress in Chapter  fixed the -month period, 
which would give -- have a sort of a gravitational pull
 
You wouldn't want to throw that out too lightly
 Justice Sotomayor, I do agree that we ought to be pretty -- we ought to stick to it
 It indicates Congress is concerned with the -month period
 But it's not like Congress added to Chapter  this -month 
concept
 It added it to Chapter , where it's in full force and effect
  
 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you -- you have lost me
 MR
 GOLDSTEIN: Okay
 JUSTICE SCALIA: MR
 GOLDSTEIN: Sure
 It's back
 We have to go back two pages
 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I got -- I got it there
 MR
 GOLDSTEIN: Okay
 Sure
 I'm sorry
 Can I make one other point about that language, just to repeat it again? That the courts The term is "current monthly income
" So we are in Chapter , so four lines down"
 "The court shall presume abuse exists if the debtor's current monthly 
income" -- that's the  months, current monthly income
 
That's the -month period of income
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I -- I see
 I see
 MR
 GOLDSTEIN: See, that's mostly where it matters
 Then Congress borrowed it in Chapter 
 But it didn't get rid of, as was pointed out before, the 
term -- "projected"; it didn't get rid of the period, 
the commitment period
 But I do want to point out something very particular about this language
 Here's the phrase: 
 "Current monthly income, reduced by the amounts 
determined under clauses , , and " -- those are 
expenses -- "and multiplied by 
" That's what my friend says the phrase "projected disposable income to 
be received over the applicable commitment period" is
 Our point is that if Congress intended that mechanical formulation, it would have used the exact 
words that I have just read from you in Chapter , 
because that's mechanical
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Without the word "projected"? MR
 GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry? JUSTICE KENNEDY: Without the word "projected"? MR
 GOLDSTEIN: That's exactly
 They used "multiplied
" And Congress did that several times in BAPCPA and before BAPCPA
 When Congress wanted, look, we are going to have a mathematical formula, it used a 
mathematical formula
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you follow his suggestion and just move the -month period, because 
the statute specifically grants that authority to the 
judge? MR
 GOLDSTEIN: Sure
 Let me make a few points about that, sir
 So I'll again read the language  
 again
 So we are on 
 It says that -- little (ii) is going to be -- it's going to be " months ending on the 
date on which current income is determined by the court 
for purposes of this title if the debtor does not file 
the schedule of current income
" A couple OF points about that
 
debtor ratchet, right
 The creditor and the trustee, if the debtor a month before confirmation gets a new job or 
their expenses go down -- let's say you had a car, but 
you know that the car payments are going to be done
 
Under the trustee's view, then you still get to count 
the car payments which are totally pretend, or if you 
got a much higher paying job
 In fact, in this case she did get a higher paying job
 Towards the end of the period, she got a raise
 And we say that has to be counted, too
 We have to have a debtor and creditor-neutral provision
 In a statute that's designed to make sure the debtor pays a 
much as possible to her creditors, it's very strange to 
put this entirely in the debtor's hands
 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this
 There seems to be at least a subtle difference between your 
position and the government's position
 You say that the projected disposable income will be different from  
 the disposable income calculated during the lookback 
period when it is known or virtually certain that there 
will be differences in income or expenses
 And the government says that there is a difference when 
something is likely to occur in the future
 Where do you -- where do you get from the statute your known or virtually certain differences? MR
 GOLDSTEIN: The contrast between  and 
 What I tried to do in my brief, and I have laid it out at the beginning of the argument section
 
That's where we try to articulate our rule
 What we have done is we have looked at the cases
 As you pointed out, this is pre-BAPCPA practice
 Courts have set a pretty high bar, both in terms of the level of 
certainty and the degree of deviation
 And courts have said -- I will give you an example that will illustrate the difference perhaps
 
You have times when someone expects to get a raise
 
They don't know that they are going to get it, or they 
expect to get a promotion
 And courts will say, even if that's pretty likely, until you have actually got it we 
are not going to count it for purposes of (b); come 
back under 
 And we point out in our merits brief that in fact, it's not quite on point, but she got a settlement  
 post-confirmation here, and under  that money was 
applied
 So, Justice Scalia, there are post-confirmation events, but if you know ahead of 
time -- and this case is a perfect example, it -- we 
know she is not going to get another buyout from Payless 
Shoe Stores
 When it's known or virtually certain, we think that is sufficient -- akin to Justice Sotomayor's 
point about, you know, making it hard
 Let me make one other point
 I wanted to finish off my answer to the Chief Justice about 
 
This provision has taken on greater significance in the 
oral argument and the reply brief of the Petitioner
 I did want to point out to the Court a provision that is 
not reproduced in the parties' briefs, but if the Court 
were to go this route it would want to be aware of, and 
that's (i)
 And (i) tells us that you do have to file the forms at the beginning or you have to file them 
within  days, but upon request of the debtor made 
within  days after the date of filing the petition, 
the court may allow the debtor an additional period of 
not to exceed  days
 So it does seem to constrain the power of the bankruptcy court to shift this period all 
around
  
 So, I have made two points
 One is it's a one-way ratchet for the debtor; second, it's not 
unlimited
 The third is it just doesn't make any sense
 Why would Congress design a system that would have all 
of these machinations
 If we agree that Congress wants -- it seems my friend and I agree that Congress 
believes that she shouldn't have to make the payments 
that would be required under the trustee's reading of 
"projected disposable income
" The question is how we get there
 The trustee's answer is that you are required by the text; I'm sorry, Congress took this 
option away
 And I think that, as I have explained, the term "projected disposable income to be received in the 
applicable commitment period" really is not language 
that you would ordinarily construe to ignore changes 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think -- I think that's exactly right when you look at term 
"projected disposable income
" MR
 GOLDSTEIN: Yes
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if you look as MR
 GOLDSTEIN: Yes
 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- as a defined term 
different -- different argument, different kettle of 
fish
 I mean, because particularly in a statute intended to restrict discretion, it's a way to do it
 
You look at it in the abstract, "projected disposable 
income," it doesn't achieve that objective
 MR
 GOLDSTEIN: And that is exactly, Mr
 Chief Justice, why I started with the definition of 
"current monthly income in the -month period
" I agree that it is an important point
 It is their strongest argument
 My only point is that I have explained, I think, why Congress put the -month period in for 
purposes of Chapter  and also to have the starting 
point
 If I -- to give you an example, take inflation
 If we were to define inflation as the amount in the rise 
in prices over the previous  months, if Congress did 
that in a statute and then told us to look at projected 
inflation, we would still not ignore things that will 
tell us that there are going to be -- there has been an 
oil price spike or an increase in health care costs
 It would take a pretty firm, firm period that told us to 
only look into the past and not look into the future, 
particularly when the whole point of the statute is to 
 make sure that the money goes into the creditor's hands 
that the debtor is able to pay
 On the point of discretion, I should also say BAPCPA as a whole was intended to reduce discretion
 
And, so, it's kind of odd to say that the answer to our 
position is to turn to all of these other discretionary 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if you -- you wanted to achieve your friend's result and you had a 
definition of disposable income, and you wanted the 
court to -- you don't want to say project that forward, 
what -- what word would be more natural than saying 
projected? MR
 GOLDSTEIN: I -- I -- I would use the language that Congress did in 
 Remember, the current monthly income reduced by the amounts determined 
under clauses , , and  and multiplied by 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's altering disposable income -- the definition of disposable 
income
 I'm asking isn't the most natural word to achieve your friend's result to use projected
 What other word would you say when you say this is the period 
you look at and you want to take it forward? MR
 GOLDSTEIN: Multiply
 And Congress did that a bunch of times
 Projected -- if we try to  
 project something, we try and make the -- and everybody 
agrees on the definition, so really, it's not an unusual 
term
 It is: You make your best estimate of the future based on the data you have now
 My friend is right
 One piece of data we have now is her previous  months' 
income
 Another piece of data is we know that she's not going to have the same income in the future
 If there are no further questions
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel
 Ms
 Harrington
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH HARRINGTON ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT MS
 HARRINGTON: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In bankruptcy, as in many areas of the law, Congress has tried to balance on the one hand, doing 
case-specific justice, and on the other hand, ensuring 
that the statutory scheme is administrable
 Now, Congress certainly could have chosen to elevate 
simplicity over accuracy by telling bankruptcy courts to 
take a debtor's current disposable income and multiply 
that number by the number of months in the plan in 
assessing whether the plan is confirmable
 But there are several strong signals in the code that that is  
 actually not what Congress intended courts to do
 JUSTICE ALITO: But do you think bankruptcy courts are supposed to be economic forecasters? For example, if you -- after calculating the debtor's income 
during the -month period, the -month lookback period, 
should the bankruptcy court said, well -- say: Well, it's -- inflation is projected to be such-and-such over 
the term of this plan, so I am just going to increase it 
by the amount of inflation; or: This person works in a particular industry where historically, over the last 
five years or ten years, there's been a  percent 
increase in salary per year, so I'm going to multiply it 
by -- multiply the disposable income figure like that? MS
 HARRINGTON: Certainly not, Justice Alito
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why not? You say that the bankruptcy courts should take into account things 
that are likely to occur in the future
 MS
 HARRINGTON: we are not saying that bankruptcy courts should ever 
speculate about what might happen in the future
 What we are saying is that bankruptcy courts should take into 
account what they know, in this case, already has 
happened, but also what they know will happen
 And so to give an example of a change that would benefit  
 creditors, if as -- as I mentioned earlier, if a debtor 
has secured a higher-paying job just before or just 
after she filed her petition, a Court should be able to 
take into account the fact that her income going forward 
would be greater than would be reflected in the 
calculation of her current disposable income
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, "know will happen" is quite different from "likely to happen," and I thought 
your test was likely to happen
 MS
 HARRINGTON: Well, likely to happen based on what you know now
 I think -- we haven't suggested a particular burden of proof
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not likely, based on what you know
 Well, that's quite different from you know it will happen
 MS
 HARRINGTON: Right
 So there is an example mentioned earlier: If the debtor is repaying a loan to her (k) program, that is the type of loan 
that can't be extended time-wise
 And so she will keep making those payments, which will be deducted as an 
expense in the calculation of her current disposable 
income, but -- but you know at a certain point, she is 
likely to stop making those payments
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there a difference between your test and the Respondent's test?  
 MS
 HARRINGTON: Not according to what I heard Mr
 Goldstein say at the argument
 Again, we do JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: His words were "known to a virtual certainty," which are -- likely to happen is 
different than likely to happen
 MS
 HARRINGTON: I think, in part, it depends on what type of change you are talking about
 
Again, we would never say that a court should speculate 
about what should happen
 But, for instance, to take another example on the expense side, if a debtor when 
she proposes her plan owns a second home, a vacation 
home that is secured by a mortgage, then that secured 
debt payment is an expense that would be deducted from 
her income in the calculation of her current disposable 
income
 But if she proposes to surrender that property as a condition of her plan, she will no longer have that 
debt payment going forward
 And so that's the type of -- so it will no longer be an expense going forward
 
Under Petitioner's view, a court would not be able to 
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's "know will happen
" That is "know will happen
" But I don't know how you can, at one and the same time, say: Courts shall not speculate, and then say that the test is 
 "likely to happen
" MS
 HARRINGTON: JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, to -- you know, to look forward and say: Is it likely or not likely? That's speculation
 I don't know a better definition of speculation, to tell you the truth
 MS
 HARRINGTON: Okay
 But then, we wouldn't -- we are not trying to advance that view of 
"likely
" And again, in this case the change had already occurred, so there is no uncertainty about what 
her situation is now and what we can project it to be 
going forward
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that, 
well, depending on how broad a theory you are adopting 
of what's projected and what's not, that you are taking 
into account a lot of things that are more properly 
taken into account when it comes to whether the plan 
should be confirmed or not
 MS
 HARRINGTON: CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's going to happen? What's the situation going to be? What should, you know, the creditors get? What should the debtor get? There is no reason to kind of shoehorn those into the projected disposable income
  
 MS
 HARRINGTON: Well, except that if the creditor or a trustee objects, then the calculation of 
projected disposable income is one of the conditions of 
confirmability of the plan
 The court can't confirm it CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is that -- I mean, let's say your friend wins up to the point and 
somebody else, when it gets to confirmation, can say: 
Well, look, you know, there was this big payout before 
the filing
 So don't confirm it
 We know she has got all this -- all this other money
 That -- it could do it that way, couldn't it? MS
 HARRINGTON: I'm sorry, if she got a higher-paying job just before? Is that what you're suggesting? CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, whatever the situation is, can't that be taken into account when it 
comes to confirmation? MS
 HARRINGTON: Well, it could affect the -- well, one thing that is important to note that hasn't 
been brought up is under Section (a)(), the court 
is actually -- which is the feasibility provision -- the 
Court is actually required to think about what is going 
to happen in the future, whether a debtor is going to be 
able to repay her creditors
 And so it doesn't make 
 very much sense to, on the one hand, require a court to 
consider what it knows will happen in the future in 
determining feasibility, and then on the other hand, if 
there's an objection by the creditor or the trustee and 
(b) comes into play, to prohibit a court from 
considering the same facts it knows about what is going 
JUSTICE ALITO: What if the debtor is a waiter and during the last month of the -month period, 
because of some change of the economy the waiter's tips 
have gone up either way up or way down? What's the court supposed to do then? MS
 HARRINGTON: Well, I think one purpose of having the -month lookback period in the calculation 
of current income is exactly to take into account those 
situations
 There are many people who are gainfully employed full time, but whose -- whose income fluctuates 
over time
 And so requiring that courts use the -month lookback period, I think, gives creditors a better sense 
of whether the current income figure provided by the 
debtor is accurate
 It reduces the chance for strategic filing because it sort of takes some of the significance 
away of the time of filing
 And so it seems fairer in that case to consider that -month average in a case where income  
 fluctuates up and down as an accurate sense of what the 
-- what the debtor's current income is
 And again, in many -- in a significant number of cases the calculation 
of a current disposable income will be a good prediction 
of what the debtor's disposable income will be going 
forward
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you deal with the Petitioner's -- the two arguments Petitioner makes? One is that on the expense side, Congress provided for 
special circumstances, exceptions, and it didn't on the 
income side? MS
 HARRINGTON: Well, the special circumstances exception comes in, in the calculation of 
the debtor's current disposable income, but it doesn't 
tell you what to do in terms of projecting that 
disposable income
 And so you can adjust what you think the current disposable income is based on an expense 
that isn't accounted for in the standard expenses or an 
expense that is accounted for, but is higher than is 
accounted for in those expenses
 But again, it doesn't tell you what to do -- how to project that number going 
forward
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the argument that this is a simple thing; she didn't have to file the 
plan -- she didn't have to file the petition at a time  
 when those two months would be in the -month lookback
 
She could have waited
 MS
 HARRINGTON: Well, that is certainly true of this debtor, of the Respondent in this case
 
That is not an option available to all debtors, many of 
whom are facing foreclosure proceedings or imminent 
foreclosure proceedings
 Delay is simply not an option
 And if I could address Section (A)(A)(ii) option that the Petitioner offers -- I 
mean, one thing to note is it doesn't give the Court the 
discretion to set any other -- to just pick any other 
-month lookback period
 They pick a date and go  months back from whatever that date is
 So if a change occurs very soon before the filing of the petition, it 
makes it very hard for a court to use that provision to 
change the lookback period because you would have to 
wait  months, essentially, after the filing of the 
petition to set it back
 But again, the biggest problem with using that section as a workaround is that that is an option 
that is available to debtors, but not to creditors
 If a debtor files a Chapter  petition along with all the 
Schedules that are required under Section  of the 
code, then the debtor has no option for -- excuse me, 
the creditor has no option and the trustee has no  
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the creditor has the option of objecting the confirmation of the 
plan
 MS
 HARRINGTON: They can object to confirmation of the plan, but on what -- what basis? If the Petitioner argues that the calculation of projected 
disposable income is merely a mechanical multiplication 
of the current disposable income times  or , then 
they have no way of allowing the court to take account 
of a change that has happened just before or after the 
time of the petition that would inure to the creditor's 
benefit
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They can't say: I object because the -month period is unrepresentative 
because of this particular event? MS
 HARRINGTON: They could say that, but it's not clear in the code that that is a basis for 
refusing to confirm a plan
 I think they would have to CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the government have a position on that? MS
 HARRINGTON: I think unless there were bad faith it's not clear how that can be a basis for not 
confirming a plan, and that was the -- the reason that  
 moment, in , was subject to a conviction that 
carried a life sentence
 And it was the State that elected to go forward at that point and to seek a new 
death sentence
 And all our position is, is that when 
and the Alabama trial court at Pet App
 a called this 
a "complete and new assessment of the evidence and the 
law" -- when this new hearing was held it had to comport 
with the Constitution
 I don't think even the State disputes that all the -- all parts of the Constitution applied in that 
context
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: MR
 FISHER: JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you -- you say -- you present this argument that it is a second petition and 
you say that's the only issue before us and there is no 
other way that the new proceeding would be cut off under 
AEDPA
 There was in this case, in the first -- when the -- the sentence was set -- set aside, an order by 
the district judge; and it said: Magwood, I want you now to bring out all conceivable -- all conceivable 
claims on pain of forfeiture
 Why doesn't that alone -- this is an order  
 by the court: I don't want you to engage in seriatim litigation; I want you to bring forward all conceivable 
claims
 And that was an order and it was made on pain of forfeiture
 Why isn't that dispositive of this case? MR
 FISHER: Because that order was entered in one case, and now we have an entirely different case, 
Justice Ginsburg
 That order was entered in the case under which Mr
 Magwood challenged his  judgment
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but what he's bringing up now was a conceivable claim that he could 
have brought up then
 MR
 FISHER: Well, it's not -- it was not claim he could have brought, and this is an important 
point, Justice Ginsburg
 Under res judicata law, he is not making, as the State would say, the same claim now 
as he could have made then
 The fact that he is challenging a different judgment by definition makes it 
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the issue is the same
 The issue is that he didn't qualify for the death penalty because at the time he committed this offense, 
there had to be, in addition to the eligible offense, at 
least one aggravator
 MR
 FISHER: That's right
 The legal -- the legal issue that he is raising is one that he could have  
 raised then
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So why doesn't preclusion result from the court's order that says: Bring up all conceivable claims? MR
 FISHER: Because you can't waive something by failing to raise it in a different case
 
This is an entirely different case, in the district 
JUSTICE BREYER: you get to Justice Alito's question, because in fact 
what we have here is we have piece of paper issued in 
, and on that piece of paper it says: You, Billy Joe Magwood, are guilty and sentenced to death by 
electrocution
 Then we have another piece of paper which was issued in , and that says: You are ordered and adjudged guilty of the offense of aggravated 
murder and sentenced to death by electrocution
 So the words are identical
 And one was issued in ' and one was issued in '
 So you are saying since ' -- this piece of paper in ' is a new judgment, you can start all over
 
So then the question comes up, well, if you can start 
all over in respect to anything, why can't you start all 
over in respect to everything? But you recognize that that would be a mess, because all the things that were  
 never challenged here, like those things related to 
guilt, they could all come up again, too, even though he 
has never done it
 So what is -- what is -- what is your answer? Clearly you are going to start saying some things if it wasn't at issue you can bring up, and 
others you can't; and once you are down that track, how 
do we know whether these are on one side or the other? MR
 FISHER: So let me answer that in practical terms and then get back to Justice Alito by 
giving a -- giving statutory hook for it
 In practical terms, even though the new judgment, which is at Pet
 App
 a, reimposes the 
conviction, it's not anything new as to that conviction
 
If it were a new judgment as to that conviction, the 
State of Alabama would have to have a whole new trial on 
guilt/innocence, and it didn't
 JUSTICE BREYER: It is something new in respect to the sentence
 MR
 FISHER: Pardon me? JUSTICE BREYER: It is something new in respect to the sentence
 MR
 FISHER: It is new because of the brandnew sentence, Your Honor
 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah! But it is not new in  
 respect to the words
 They are identical
 MR
 FISHER: JUSTICE BREYER: MR
 FISHER: JUSTICE BREYER: -- is the sentence was reimposed
 So why not those things? Does your concession on the first part, which I agree is necessary, imply a concession on the 
second part, that it's not new in respect to what might 
have been brought up before? MR
 FISHER: No, it doesn't
 Look at this Court's decision in Lawlor
 This is discussed in our opening brief, I believe around page , and it's a res 
judicata case
 And what the Court held in that case is if somebody does something to somebody, the exact same 
thing multiple times, you can bring a new case when they 
do it to you the second time or the third time, and you 
can make arguments that were never made the first time
 
There is no waiver, there is no forfeiture, and the 
reason you can do it is you are challenging a new 
injury
 So Mr
 Magwood under -- even under res judicata law, which this Court has said is stricter than 
habeas law, even under res judicata law he would have 
the right to bring this claim as to the sentence because  
 it's challenging something new
 Now let me get back to the statute, because this is important
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me
 The reason Lawlor doesn't work is what you have there is different 
acts
 The later judgment is -- is not just a later judgment with respect to the same act
 It's a later judgment with -- with respect to a different act
 Here you are saying you want to apply the same rule with 
respect to a later judgment, redoing the judgment for 
the same prior act
 And I don't think that the same rule has to apply
 MR
 FISHER: With all due respect, I think Lawlor does apply
 One example in that case is an abatable nuisance
 Imagine that smoke goes over and pollutes somebody's property every -- every first day of 
January every year
 Somebody brings a lawsuit about that saying it violates certain laws, and they lose
 If the next year smoke goes over the property again, you 
can bring a lawsuit for the identical thing
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not the identical thing
 The last one was for the smoke that went last year
 The next one is for the smoke that went this year
 MR
 FISHER: Fair enough
  
 same here
 The first case Mr
 Magwood brought was about the  judgment sentencing him to death, and this case 
is about the 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: The same act of his
 I'm talking about the act that is the basis of the lawsuit
 MR
 FISHER: JUSTICE SCALIA: It's the very same act
 MR
 FISHER: But all we are talking about here is not the same act
 The same act as to the conviction carries over, but this was, as the trial 
court put it, a complete and new assessment of the 
evidence
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I -- I want you to get -- on the assessment of the evidence, I just want 
to ask -- I probably should know this, and you can get 
back to Justice Alito's question as well
 Under Alabama procedure, at the sentencing hearing both in the first 
trial and the second, is there evidence about the 
aggravating and mitigating, or do you just look at the 
evidence that was proven in the guilt phase? MR
 FISHER: JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there new witnesses, et cetera? MR
 FISHER: As it turns out, the parties did not put new witnesses on the stand
 But the trial  
 judge was explicit -- and this is in the -- in the order 
that's in the back of the appendix -- it was explicit 
that the parties had the right to do that
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: MR
 FISHER: JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- not clear to me why death eligibility wasn't a part of the first conviction
 MR
 FISHER: Because death eligibility hinges on the finding of an aggravating circumstance
 
And so that was vacated when the -- when the -- when the 
State elected to go forward and tried to reimpose a 
death sentence and the -- reimpose a new death sentence 
and the trial judge found new -- it turned out to be the 
same aggravating circumstance, but it found an 
aggravating circumstance all over again
 Imagine, Justice Kennedy, the State if it had wanted to at the second death sentence hearing could 
have submitted evidence to try to prove a new 
aggravating circumstance
 The defendants could have submitted evidence trying to prove new mitigating 
circumstances
 Now, Mr
 -- Justice Alito, I think it's important to get back to your question for the second 
actual hook for my argument, and it's the words "second 
or successive
" It has to -- in some way to make any  
 sense of the statute, you have to say it's second or 
successive as to something
 Now, if you look at McCleskey, which is this Court's most thorough consideration of that concept, it 
says again and again in that decision what makes it 
second or successive is that you are asking for the same 
thing you have been denied before
 You are coming back, as -- as -- as it used to be the case, you are filing, 
in effect, an appeal, endless appeals from the denials 
that you have been getting
 We are giving meaning to "second or successive" by saying that it's second or successive if 
you are asking for relief that has been denied before
 
It is not second or successive if it's the first time 
you are challenging something new that the State's 
imposed
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Fisher -- Mr
 Fisher, to get -- I get your "second, it's a new judgment
" But thinking in terms of what AEDPA was attempting to do, we 
have two claims, one after the other
 The second claim is one that would take away the death penalty forever, 
that would be it, because he said the only sentence I 
can get is life without parole
 He brings instead, first, one that doesn't make him -- that still leaves him exposed to the death  
 penalty
 So the court has been put upon twice
 If he had brought the first claim and he is right about that, 
he's not death eligible
 Instead, he brings a claim that still leaves him death eligible, and the court has 
been burdened twice, when easily he could have brought, 
as the district judge instructed him to do, everything 
the first time
 MR
 FISHER: Justice Ginsburg, I'm going to tell you two things
 First of all, with -- with respect to the two different claims, given the severity of 
Mr
 Magwood's mental illness, I think there was every 
reason to expect that prevailing on that claim in the 
Eleventh Circuit would have put an end to the State's 
decision to seek the death penalty in this case
 As it turns out, it didn't and the State went forward
 But also understand that the State's argument here, to the extent you are ordering the claims 
in sort of a level of importance, would apply even if 
the opposite were true, even if Mr
 Magwood had brought 
the -- had brought some other claim the first time and 
prevailed on it
 Any claim, the State says, that you could have raised the first time is forever barred
 And that gets to, well, I still don't think I have quite 
answered the question on second or successive, so let me  
 continue that
 We are giving meaning to that term "second or successive
" It's important to understand that, whatever slight difficulty you have with the word 
"judgment" and making sense of the words "second or 
successive" in our case are dwarfed by the interpretive 
difficulties, in fact the impossibilities, with respect 
to the State's proposal
 The State's proposal -- and it's laid out at page  of its brief, at the top of the page, right 
after the number  -- the State's proposed rule -- and I 
think it's useful to put it next to the statute
 The State's proposed rule is if a claim could have been or 
was raised in a prior petition, it is barred by Section 
 () or ()
 Now, the first thing you will notice is that the words "second or successive" appear nowhere in the 
State's rule
 The State gives no definition, no meaning whatsoever, to those concepts
 What the State is trying to do is -- is ask this Court to create a brandnew 
waiver system, a brandnew waiver system for all second 
in time petitions
 And we know -- we know from Martinez-Villareal and Slack and other cases that second 
in time petitions are not necessarily successive and  
 certainly they ought not to be thought of as successive 
when they challenge a different judgment or a different 
conviction or the like
 But what the State is asking for is a brandnew waiver system that has never been imposed in 
any decision from this Court and there have been three 
decisions from this Court where it would have come up
 
One is Burton, another is Richmond, which is cited in 
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how -- how does the State's definition at page  of the red brief not 
comport with the whole idea of second or successive? MR
 FISHER: Because the only way to get the idea of second or successive into the State's definition 
is where it says prior habeas petition
 So, the only way that a State can even be pretending to give meaning 
to that would be a second in time petition
 Now, we know that can't be enough because of Slack and Martinez-Villareal
 But even more than that, we know that can't be enough because it would -- it 
would prohibit defendants from bringing second habeas 
petitions even as to things that are novel as to -- a 
second in time rule would apply section 's rules to 
even second in time petitions that are brandnew things 
that arose at the retrial or resentencing
  
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: that's not something that could have been or was raised
 MR
 FISHER: That's right, Justice Kennedy
 So the State creates additional statutory language that 
doesn't exist
 It could have been or a previously available rule
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's an issue that we look at all the time under AEDPA
 That's not a new approach
 AEDPA says, you know, if you show that a claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law made 
retroactive, that was previously unavailable
 That seems to me to be the same inquiry, as to whether or not 
a claim could not have been raised in a prior habeas 
petition
 MR
 FISHER: I disagree, Mr
 Chief Justice
 You do look at those questions once it has been 
determined that a petition is second or successive
 You have never looked at those questions in order to 
determine somehow whether it gets in the door
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's an -- I thought your point -- I thought your point was, oh, this is 
going to be hard to do, impossible, as you say
 MR
 FISHER: Well, I can tell you lots of reasons why that would be the case
 So, let me give you some examples
 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait
 before you get off whether this is second or successive, 
although the -- the State didn't put it this way, I 
think what the State is clearly saying is that if it is 
the second petition that could have raised this issue, 
it is second or successive
 What's wrong with that? MR
 FISHER: JUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't that fit -- fit the statutory language? MR
 FISHER: Because the word the statute used, Justice Scalia, is "claim," not issue
 And this is not the same claim
 JUSTICE SCALIA: MR
 FISHER: Lawlor tells you that, and res judicata
 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it doesn't use "judgment," either, and -- and -- and you are -- you are 
MR
 FISHER: Well, it refers to section , and section  uses the word "judgment," so it's 
our belief it is by incorporation
 But to get back to your precise question, it's important because the statute does not use the 
words "issue" or "argument
" It uses the word "claim," which is a defined term in legal parlance
 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay
 So if -- if this is the -- if this is the second time that this claim could 
have been presented, it's a second -- it's a second or 
successive claim
 MR
 FISHER: But, Justice Scalia, this is not the second time this claim could have been 
presented
 In  or ' when he filed his first habeas petition, he couldn't make this claim because 
this judgment didn't even exist
 There would be no way to challenge this judgment
 And I'm not being overly technical here
 I just urge you to look at res judicata law
 Now let me give you some examples of the difficulties the State system would raise
 First of all, with -- with respect to intervening authority
 The State itself concedes in its brief that it's not clear 
how its system would apply in the case of somebody who 
gets habeas relief and then later wants to seek habeas 
relief based on an intervening decision of this Court
 Up until now that has been a perfectly easy situation because the new judgment allows a new claim to 
be brought, but under the State's rule it's unclear
 To the extent that the State says, well, what we would have 
to do is look and see -- look and see whether if there 
was fair notice of that decision, the defendant would 
 have raised it
 That gets into very difficult situations about how new is the decision
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me -- it seems to me those are the exact same problems that would 
arise, do arise, under AEDPA
 You have got to show that it's a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive
 MR
 FISHER: But that's not the State's rule, Mr
 Chief Justice
 It's very easy to say whether this Court has made a decision retroactive
 It would be
 It hasn't happened, but I imagine it would be very easy
 The State's rule is any new decision from this Court gives the defendant a new -- gives potential 
rise to a debate as to whether or not that claim was 
previously available
 Let me tick off a couple of other things before I sit down
 What about a situation the first time where a claim is Teague-barred or procedurally 
precluded or maybe even the defendant doesn't raise it 
because under the facts that the first trial went 
forward, it would have been harmless error
 All of those situations would raise very difficult questions as to whether that claim, as the 
State would put it, was previously available
 Even, again, go back to the idea of having a new trial based  
 on new -- based on new facts and new evidence
 Trying to figure out whether it's the same claim, a different 
claim; imagine a claim based on a prosecutor's closing 
argument
 Well, unless the prosecutor reads the exact same script a second time, there is going to be a huge 
fight over whether it's a new claim, an old claim, a 
different claim
 And finally, the State's other -- the other prong of the State's test is about claims that were 
raised before are now barred
 Now, the State immediately recognizes that that's a huge problem 
because it would bar defendants from making -- from 
seeking habeas relief if the State made the same 
violation the second time around
 So it invents a brand-new due process principle that has never been held 
to be -- to be in existence by this Court
 And indeed, in the Penry case, where this Court dealt with the Texas 
situation, where the State court made the same error 
twice, it went straight to the constitutional claim
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if it's the second -- I see your light's on
 If it's the second time around, then it's just barred by law of the case
 MR
 FISHER: Well, it -- well, it shouldn't be barred
 Because it's a new judgment, the defendant should be able to get relief the second time around
 It  
 would be a very strange construction of the habeas 
statute, and it wouldn't be law of the case because it 
would be a new case, again, Justice Kennedy
 And finally, let me give you the situation of claims the defendant raises but then loses on but is 
unable to appeal
 Imagine a case like this where the defendant has many other claims that he loses on in the 
district court or in the court of appeals
 Now, the State has a pickle here
 It has to either say that those claims are forever barred from being raised again, even though the 
defendant was deprived of a full right to appeal because 
he won on something else and couldn't appeal the losses 
on the other issues, or the State has to say that those 
were -- that those were not previously available, those 
claims were not previously available, in which all of 
its rhetoric about resurrecting past claims drops away
 Again, a very difficult question that this Court's going to have to grapple with if it accepts the 
State's rule
 I would like to reserve what time I have left
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr
 Fisher

 Maze
  
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF COREY L
 MAZE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MR
 MAZE: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Even though they rose together, the State has litigated Magwood's mitigating circumstances in 
Federal court from  to , and now we have been 
litigating these aggravating circumstances from  
through today
 That's piecemeal litigation
 That's precisely the reason that AEDPA was passed under (b) 
and that's precisely what the abuse of the writ doctrine 
was designed to prevent
 And it's based on the principle that this Court unanimously affirmed again yesterday
 You have equitable principles that say when you have two parties, 
a party has a full and fair opportunity to praise a 
claim or to litigate
 But the other party also has a finality interest
 And once you take away your full and fair opportunity by not using it, the other party's 
interest in finality outweighs
 That's what Congress envisioned in AEDPA
 That's what this Court envisioned with the abuse of the write doctrine
 That's why we don't allow someone who had a claim previously available 
that didn't use it to bring it again
 And if I may, I want to go straight to 
 Justice Alito's question about conviction versus 
sentence, and then to Justice Kennedy's about whether or 
not under Alabama law this is aggravated with something 
new to the resentencing
 As far as judgment -- conviction versus sentence, I had two answers
 Justice Breyer got to the first
 On page , the new judgment, as Mr
 Magwood would say, says, "I hereby judge you convicted of the 
underlying offense in the actual guilt phase and the 
sentence
" So it contains both, if you consider that a new judgment
 But the second point is, if Magwood is correct that you can separate a judgment of sentence and 
conviction, then Burton is wrong
 Burton has to be wrong
 Because the argument in Burton was -- he cited In Re Taylor, which was the exact same case we put in 
our brief
 He said: My first petition attacked the judgment of conviction; my second petition attacked the 
judgment of resentence, and because those are two 
separate judgments, this was my first chance to attack 
the judgment of sentence
 And this Court said: No, it's one judgment; it's conviction and sentence
 And because your first petition attacked that judgment that contained both, 
your second petition attacks the same judgment that  
 contained both
 So if Mr
 Magwood is right that you can separate the two, then Burton has to be wrong
 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I think what you would have to do -- it's a dilemma here
 MR
 FISHER: Right
 JUSTICE BREYER: What you would have to say to follow his approach, is you would say: Judge, here is what you would do
 They're filing it from the second judgment
 Okay? So it is not second or successive
 But wait
 If there is a first judgment that says the same thing, then it is, in effect, the first 
judgment that counts
 Now, what happens when there is a change? Well, to note the scope of the change, you would go to 
the habeas court and you would say, to the extent that 
MR
 MAZE: Right
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- or left open or told the lower court: Do this over; to that extent, it is a new judgment
 And that -- that would get them where they want to go
 MR
 MAZE: And you just answered Justice Kennedy's question
 The question in this case is: What changed? If you'll look at the district  
 court's opinion, its order from the first case -- it's 
page  of the opinion -- it said: The Court finds that this case must be remanded to the State court for 
resentencing on the existence of mitigating 
circumstances, rather than two
 Justice Kennedy's JUSTICE BREYER: Wait
 Wait
 Wait
 Wait right there
 I would have read that to say that what he said was: Vacate the sentencing part
 Now, you say: Well, vacate the sentencing part; fine
 Now we look at the second judgment, and we say: It's a new judgment
 Oh, but it isn't
 MR
 MAZE: Right
 JUSTICE BREYER: Insofar as that habeas didn't tinker with it
 But they did tinker with it, because they vacated the sentencing part
 Now, why doesn't that work? And his argument is, that works much easier for the judges, much 
easier for everybody, than to try to figure out whether 
a claim could have or couldn't have been raised, whether 
a sentence was changed from six years to five years, or 
who knows what we are going to get into; et cetera
 MR
 MAZE: Because it's one of two things
 Either you vacated the entire judgment and the 
conviction and sentence are put back together -- they  
 are -- it is a new judgment altogether
 Or you look at specifically what the constitutional infirmity was that 
the Court identified in that case
 The answer to Justice Kennedy's question is: There are four things under Alabama law at the time of 
this case that were necessary to have a death sentence
 
The first was an indictment with an aggravating 
circumstance
 The second was a conviction of a capital offense
 The third was the State announcing an aggravating circumstance
 And the fourth was a penalty phase recommendation from the jury that was unanimous
 When this case went back, all four of those things were carried over from the first trial
 We didn't do any of those things again
 They were all carried over
 They are relics from the original trial
 The only thing new that happened was we added the two 
mitigators to the weighing calculus and it was 
reweighed
 And we know that is true from the district court's opinion in the second case
 Mr
 Magwood claimed that he could bring a claim against the fact that we didn't re-empanel the 
penalty phase jury, which, again, is a sentencing claim, 
and the district court said no, the State court didn't 
have to re-empanel the jury to give another 
recommendation, because that wasn't the problem in the  
 first case
 The only problem in the first case was not having the two additional mitigators
 And under the same rationale, the State's announcement of the 
aggravator was also a relic from the first case
 And in fact, we know that, because in the circuit court's 
opinion in the first case, it specifically told the 
State court: If you will weigh the same aggravating circumstance against the four instead of two, we won't 
question your judgment
 JUSTICE BREYER: This argument -- I am making it up, but I mean, he doesn't have to apply these 
arguments -- but it seems to me that the argument 
against this is: What you are proposing is too complicated
 There are thousands of these in the courts of appeals
 All you would like is you would like the court of appeals to look back and say: What part of the original sentence did the district court, habeas, 
vacate? MR
 MAZE: Right
 JUSTICE BREYER: Not look into the reasons for it, et cetera
 Because once we start going into the reasons for it, the litigation is just going to 
mushroom
 MR
 MAZE: Right
 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and, you know, you  
 have this new witness but not that new witness, et 
cetera
 So his argument is one from simplicity
 Start with the judgment
 Second, keep it the same insofar as the district court didn't vacate it
 And deal with it as a new judgment, which it is, insofar as they did
 MR
 MAZE: There is a simple answer to why the Federal courts can deal with this, and we know they 
can deal with it
 And the answer is: When this happens on direct appeal in a Federal prisoner's case -- for 
example, if a Federal prisoner says you shouldn't have 
enhanced my sentence for this one reason, and he gets a 
remand where the sentence is vacated, he is resentenced 
and it comes back up -- the circuit courts are 
unanimous
 They all say you can't challenge other enhancers from the original sentence because you could 
have raised it the first time
 I can give you case after case after case where they have done that
 A good example: Judge Posner had the case U
S
 v
 Parker  at rd , where he says the exact same thing and his 
analysis is exactly what we are saying
 A party cannot use the accident of a remand to raise in a second appeal 
an issue that he just as well could have raised in the 
first appeal
 And the principle is exactly the same, that the Federal courts in State habeas will look to see 
is this was an issue you could have raised the first  
 time, and if it was, you are out
 It would make no sense under AEDPA for a Federal prisoner on direct appeal to give the U
S
 
government a finality interest in enhancers that could 
have been challenged the first time, but not to give the 
same finality interest to States when they are coming 
into Federal court under AEDPA for aggravators that have 
been challenged the first time
 Again, the whole purpose of AEDPA was to give finality to the State
 If Federal government is going to get a greater interest 
than the States, then AEDPA is completely -- I mean, 
it's just completely wrong
 Now, another problem with Magwood's argument is, he is going to kill an entire line of cases, the 
Kyzer cases, where you can challenge good time credits, 
parole credits
 If you remember, in Kyzer, you said if you are challenging your good time, you can raise that 
in a  petition
 Now, under Magwood's rule, if you read it as a second or successive application against a 
judgment -- let's assume that you've lost in your first 
habeas, so your first petition is now done and you have 
lost
 Good time credits are taken away from you
 Under this Court's precedent, you raised that in a  
petition, but that petition will be the second petition 
under the same judgment
 And he would be barred because  
 the good time credit claims would meet an exception
 
It's not new facts or law that proves he's innocent, and 
therefore it is barred
 The only way that the circuits have been able to deal with that situation is exactly the way the 
State's saying here and that Justice Scalia is saying
 
You ask the question first: Is this a claim that has been available before? And if it's not a claim that was available before, and because it's a good time claim 
that wasn't, then you say this is not a second or 
successive application, because it is the first 
application in which he could have brought the claim
 
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And Mr
 Fisher uses the word "claim" as -- differently
 MR
 MAZE: Yes
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He makes a distinction between "issue" and "claim
" Yes, it's the same issue; could have been -- the issue could have been raised 
earlier, but, he says, it's not the same claim
 And the statute uses the word "claim
" MR
 MAZE: I have two answers to that, if I can, Justice Ginsburg
 The first is: This Court has defined a claim in Gonzalez v
 Crosby, which is a  
case, as the assertion of a ground that entitles the  
 Petitioner to habeas relief
 If you'll look at the question presented, Magwood agrees that this -- this says at the end: "The Petitioner could have challenged his previously imposed 
but now vacated sentence on the same constitutional 
grounds
" If the claim is grounds that can give you relief and he admits that it's the same grounds he could 
have gotten relief on the first time, it is the same 
claim
 Now, to the extent he is telling you this is a new injury, that -- the smoke example that Mr
 Magwood 
is talking about, we disagree with that; to the extent 
that he would be right, the difference is in this case, 
he asked us to blow the smoke at him a second time
 
Remember what happened in the first proceeding
 Magwood didn't challenge the aggravating circumstance, and then 
when we got to the court of appeals, he asked 
specifically the Eleventh Circuit to send this case back 
for resentencing so that the four mitigators could be 
weighed against the original aggravator
 He asked for this to go back and to -- asked to have the aggravator 
applied to him again
 So he invited the error
 This is JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what would happen if it had been sent back on this ground, but there was  
 another ground that he had appealed on which the Court never reached? MR
 MAZE: Right
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay
 Would he still be able to raise that one on habeas? MR
 MAZE: Yes
 it's just like you said in Espinoza yesterday -- you get 
one full and fair opportunity to litigate a claim
 If you raise the claim in the first petition, it's not 
abusive, as this Court said it in McCleskey, because 
McCleskey says it is only abusive if you could have but 
didn't
 And this Court's really already answered that question in Slack
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think you are right, but McCleskey was pre-AEDPA
 MR
 MAZE: It was
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What was the answer under AEDPA to Justice Scalia's problem? MR
 MAZE: I think it's the same, and the reason I say that because in Slack, you had a first 
petition that raised an exhausted claim
 It was dismissed
 He raised what everybody acknowledged was a second in time petition, but you said because he didn't 
get an adjudication on the merits, we're going to let 
him do it again
 The same thing happened in  
 Martinez-Villareal
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we just found that to be successive under the words of the statute? MR
 MAZE: Right
 But in Panetti -- if you remember, in Panetti, he raised a -- he did not raise a 
Ford claim the first time around, and this Court said 
yes, if we looked at it only a second in time, this 
would be barred, but we defined second or successive 
application under the abuse of the writ doctrine
 And because this was the first time this claim was right you 
allowed him to do it and called it a first application, 
and the reason was because he couldn't raise it the 
first time
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your answer to Justice Scalia's point: Suppose it was raised but the Court didn't decide it
 MR
 MAZE: Right
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your test, I take it, is that he must have one full and fair opportunity to 
litigate the question; that means to raise it, to have 
it aired, and to have it decided
 MR
 MAZE: Absolutely
 The point would be, it's not an abuse of the writ if you raise a claim the 
first time but don't have the chance to have it  
 adjudicated
 You abuse the writ, as this Court has always said, by having a chance to raise the claim but 
then not doing it
 JUSTICE BREYER: your view is a simple rule, no matter how many judgments 
there are
 MR
 MAZE: Right
 JUSTICE BREYER: If this claim could have been raised and would have been fully adjudicated had it 
been, it's barred
 MR
 MAZE: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: But if either it couldn't have been raised, or if it could have been raised and 
wouldn't have been fully adjudicated or was not fully 
adjudicated, not barred
 MR
 MAZE: Yes, that's it
 And that's JUSTICE BREYER: And applied to everything
 Can we reconcile that with the language? Does it work in terms of the language? MR
 MAZE: What this Court has done since AEDPA came out on two different occasions, has said the 
second or successive petition is a term of art, which 
would give substance in our previous habeas corpus 
cases, the abuse of the writ doctrine cases
  
 This Court has always said since AEDPA came out that we have to define the term by looking at what's 
an abuse of the writ
 And that's what the circuit courts have done
 The circuit courts are applying the same rule that we have given you, which is precisely 
what Justice Scalia said earlier
 JUSTICE BREYER: One judgment
 One judgment
 Never come up on appeal
 Yes, it did, the first one
 And let's see
 There were  issues that were raised
 They only answered -- you know, they answered one
 Now we go back and then five years later he wants to bring up a different one
 Fine
 You can do it
 Not second or successive
 MR
 MAZE: Can you repeat? I'm sorry
 I lost you
 JUSTICE BREYER: It -- it's there in the case
 MR
 MAZE: Okay
 The claim is available
 JUSTICE BREYER: It's one judgment
 He makes five claims
 MR
 MAZE: Okay
 Right
 JUSTICE BREYER: The district court doesn't decide, for some reason, I don't know, number  or 
 
Maybe I -- maybe it's not realistic, what I say
 Let me think about it some more
 
 MR
 MAZE: Okay
 While you are doing that, I want to make another point
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, now, just to follow up: It's very realistic
 I think a reasonable judge might decide: Look, if I can dispose of this case on ground one, you know, why should I go and decide all 
these other issues, which may be difficult? MR
 MAZE: Right
 And it does happen
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes
 And so I assume your point is that he can raise -- he can raise 
again issues that he raised before; it's no fault of his 
MR
 MAZE: Yes, that's right
 Because he didn't have the full and fair opportunity to have it 
adjudicated
 JUSTICE BREYER: Full -- see, he filed his petition -- this would get rid of -- I think there 
are -- I am worried about that there are cases out there 
that say the opposite
 But we get rid of all those cases, if there are any, and you just say that he has 
not had the full opportunity to have the litigation on a 
claim that he did raise
 MR
 MAZE: Right
 JUSTICE BREYER: Or if he couldn't have raised it, it doesn't matter if there was one judgment 
 forever
 He can raise it again and again, as long as he only does each one once, and they are not second or 
successive even if they appear in petitions , , , , 
, , and 
 MR
 MAZE: That seems to be what the Court said in Martinez-Villareal
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he'd have to bring them all in petition, too
 You can't say, you know, there are five that weren't reached and bring a separate 
habeas reach for each one of the five
 At first habeas, you would have to bring all of them, right? MR
 MAZE: Right
 And in the forum -- and in the forum rule, number  in the instructions, in big, 
bold letters, informs the Petitioner: You have to raise every claim, subject to the fact that you will lose it 
if you don't
 Now, I want to bring up a point on why this matters to the State
 On page  of our red brief, we showed you some statistics about the number of claims 
the Petitioners bring, but what we didn't cite -- it's 
on page  and  of the same study
 The study shows that after AEDPA,  percent of capital habeas petitions 
nationwide -- and if you take Texas out, it's actually 
 percent -- are granted
  percent of capital habeas petitions that are granted are granted on penalty phase  
 claims alone
 In Alabama, we looked, and we haven't found a conviction-based grant in over a decade, but we 
have had two penalty phases in the last two years
 So what Mr
 Magwood is doing is asking you to adopt the rule that,  percent of the time, would 
put the State and district courts in the position of 
relitigating an entire capital habeas case
 And what we showed you was capital habeas proceedings are the 
absolute most time-consuming cases in the district 
courts
 And he's wanting you to throw away the abuse of the writ doctrine and the successive petition doctrine 
in cases where there was a limited grant in the first case
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not the whole case
 I mean, he concedes that the conviction can't be challenged
 It's just the sentencing aspect
 MR
 MAZE: Right
 As the point we have been making with Justice Alito, I just don't see where he can 
make that distinction between conviction and sentence
 
And if this Court just comes back and says: New judgment means it resurrects, I can assure you that the 
next petitioner will come along and say: I am not making the same concession that Mr
 Magwood did; 
judgment means conviction and sentence, see Burton
 And he's going to raise  repetitive claims from his  
 conviction and from his original sentence
 And then we have the problem that the Federal district courts are 
already dealing with, if the habeas petitions, as we 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry
 Wouldn't collateral estoppel block the relitigation of all 
sentencing -- resentencing issues that were decided that 
were identical? MR
 MAZE: No, Justice Sotomayor, and the reason is collateral estoppel is a res judicata 
principle that doesn't apply to Federal habeas 
proceedings
 That's the reason that the abuse of writ doctrine and the successive petition doctrine were 
created
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what case do I read that supports that proposition? MR
 MAZE: Salinger
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I had thought that law of the case issue preclusion would apply
 MR
 MAZE: No
 The Court has always said that res judicata in -- forms, and the case to lack back 
to is all the way back to Salinger
 If you remember Salinger, he had two habeas petitions
 The first one raised a claim on which lost
 The second petition raised exactly the same claim, and he lost again
  
 And the Federal Government -- the reason he lost is because they said it was barred by res judicata, 
in this case claim preclusion
 It went up to this Court and this Court said res judicata doesn't apply in 
Federal habeas proceedings, so that court is wrong
 But we understand the problems the courts are going to have because there is no res judicata; 
therefore we are creating this abuse of the writ 
doctrine, this equitable doctrine, that will allow the 
courts to deal with the law of collateral estoppel
 The JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess if res judicata applied, you wouldn't bring habeas in the first place on 
an issue that was wrongly decided, right? If it was decided res judicata
 MR
 MAZE: Yes
 Right
 JUSTICE SCALIA: And so your -- your habeas claim would be barred
 MR
 MAZE: Right
 And -- and again, a further point would be that, you know, Mr
 Magwood keeps 
saying that just because he won, this was different
 
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the old -- the former rule of course, was that you could bring writ 
after writ after writ
 
 MR
 MAZE: Yes
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was it -- was McCleskey the first time that that -- that that was foreclosed? 
No
 MR
 MAZE: No
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that just -- that just incorporated a whole body of law which was very 
much like issue preclusion, was it not? MR
 MAZE: Yes
 No
 The courts always said it is a modified sort of res judicata, but they are 
different in some respects
 You can use it sort of as an analogy, but they are different
 The Court has said res adjudicata doesn't apply; that's why we have to have 
this similar doctrine because without it you could raise 
repetitive claims
 It was the whole reason that the rule came into existence
 JUSTICE BREYER: What happens if in the first trial, the lawyer thinks, you know, I have two 
claims here; one is mediocre and one is great
 And I'm not going to win in the court of appeals unless I make 
the great one; just forget about the mediocre
 And he brings it and he wins
 Okay? Now he goes back
 Now can he make the mediocre one? MR
 MAZE: No
 If he didn't raise it the first time, he has lost his opportunity
 That's Wong 
 Doo
 The very first case that this Court ever decided under abuse of the writ principles, Wong Doo raised two 
claims, but the second claim he decided wasn't good 
enough
 He failed to put on evidence and abandoned it
 JUSTICE BREYER: So he better put in everything
 MR
 MAZE: Right
 JUSTICE BREYER: And if he puts in everything and they don't reach the other ones, he's 
okay, because he can raise it again
 MR
 MAZE: Right
 And we will let him do that
 If the Court has no further questions
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just ask, is this the cases in which the claim is he's ineligible for the 
death penalty? MR
 MAZE: The underlying claim itself
 JUSTICE STEVENS: And is that -- is that a meritorious claim? MR
 MAZE: The first -- the first answer is, the claim itself is that I have did I have fair notice 
in  that I could get the death penalty? The claim itself, no, is not meritorious, but of course that's our 
opinion
 The Eleventh Circuit hasn't decided that issue yet, nor has it decided what has always been our  
 principle argument: this claim is also procedurally defaulted because he didn't fairly present it to the 
State courts
 The State courts never had an opportunity JUSTICE STEVENS: The merits of the claims have never been decided? MR
 MAZE: Not -- not by the State courts because it wasn't fairly presented to them
 only court to have even talked about it was the district 
court
 But again, the Eleventh Circuit hasn't dealt with it because second or successive is a jurisdictional 
question, and if the claim is second or successive, then 
it's barred and we simply haven't gotten to it
 Again, Your Honors, all we are asking you to do is uphold the abuse of the write doctrine for the 
same reason the Court adopted it in  all the way 
through AEDPA, and that is we are going to force 
petitioners to raise every claim they could the first 
time, so we prevent the State, the victim's family and 
the Federal court from going through second or third 
rounds of Federal habeas litigation on grounds they 
could have raised the first time
 If the Court has no further questions I will cede my time to the Court
  
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr
 Maze
 Mr
 Fisher, you have  minutes remaining
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L
 FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR
 FISHER: Thank you
 Let me make two points, Your Honor
 If I leave you with nothing else, think about the argument that you just heard that again and 
again talks about abuse of the writ, abuse of the writ, 
abuse of the writ
 Well, there is now a statute that occupies this field, it's section 
 And abuse of the writ principles apply only if a petition is second 
or successive
 So if this Court does nothing else, it has to define that term, and we are the only ones who 
have given you a definition of second or successive
 And Congress made that decision for a reason
 It thought it was fair to impose strict burdens oh relitigation to the extent that the defendant lost
 
But when he wins, and gets a brand-new trial or a 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we go back to Justice -- to the Chief Justice's example to you at the 
very beginning of your argument? MR
 FISHER: Pardon me? JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To the Chief Justice's 
 different categories of entities, and it's really not a 
very important tax credit, so pulling the thread isn't 
going to have much effect
 And this case -- then the case would come out differently? Comity would not bar that action? MR
 MIZER: I think it would be a much closer case, Your Honor, but still there would be an 
interest in allowing the State courts to resolve that 
challenge, because as the Court has explained, when a 
State court is -- is trying to address a constitutional 
challenge that involves the application of State law, it 
can engage in constitutional avoidance in ways that the 
Federal courts cannot
 The State courts also have greater competency, of course, with their own tax law, and they 
have a greater remedial panoply available to them
 So, in your hypothetical, Justice Alito, the -- the Federal court could not order a decrease in 
the taxes of the challenger because that, as Hibbs 
explains, would be revenue depleting, whereas if it were 
in State court, the State court could decrease the 
revenue -- sorry -- decrease the taxes of the 
challenger, and then that would allow the State courts 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume that States  
 have a law that said, we are going to do different tax 
schemes for African Americans than from whites
 And they do exactly what is done here
 They are going to tax on one thing but not on another
 They are going to give an exemption in one area, but not another
 Is that a case that would have to be -- an equal protection challenge that would have to be decided 
in State court? MR
 MIZER: Fair Assessment says in footnote  that if it doesn't -- if such a challenge doesn't 
require scrutiny of the meaning and application of State 
laws, then it may -- Fair Assessment suggests that such 
a case might be able to proceed in Federal court
 But if the -- if the challenge does require scrutiny of State law or resolution of -- of unclear 
State law questions, then it should be in State court, 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know if that is an answer to my question or not
 I -- I -- the only thing I changed in the hypothetical was that the 

based on a suspect classification
 But the credit system is no different
 Would or would not that MR
 MIZER: I see, Your Honor
 And if it  
 were equally complicated, then it is a challenge that 
should go to the State courts, because there is no doubt 
that the State court can handle Federal constitutional 
questions and along the way, they might be able to 
construe the State law in a way that avoids the 
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you reach that conclusion under the comity principles of Fair 
Assessment? MR
 MIZER: I do, but also because the Tax Injunction Act would exclude the case if it would have 
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Revenue depleting
 MR
 MIZER: -- on the State coffers
 And the remedy might, in that case, have such an effect 
if -- if the -- if the result is to tilt the balance 
heavily against a party who then needs to have its own 
taxes assessed
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I am curious to know why neither opinion in Hibbs addressed the comity principle 
and I would like your view on that
 I know what you are thinking
 Your answer is: (Laughter
) JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but, why wasn't that addressed in your view?  
 MR
 MIZER: Well, it was fully briefed in Hibbs, and that is I think why the Court addressed 
comity in footnote 
 And footnote  of Hibbs simply says that the comity doctrine doesn't cover such a 
challenge
 And the explanation, I think, of footnote  is that the Court cited both Fair Assessment and Great 
Lakes
 And those cases stand for the proposition that when a -- a tax challenge has a disruptive effect, for 
all practical purposes, on the collection or 
administration of the State tax regime, then comity bars 
it
 And so when the Court in footnote  of Hibbs said challenges are barred by comity if they arrest or 
countermand State tax collection, it was -- it was 
speaking about the kind of cases at issue
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: comity wasn't brought up in Hibbs because if the -- if 
there was an alleged constitutional violation, then 
there was only one way to go
 The parochial -- the payments to the parochial schools could not be -- had to 
be eliminated, so there was no question of abstention 
versus invalidation or doing something else that was 
fancy
 That's -- that's why this case is nothing like that, because there was only one way -- only one cure
 But you mentioned here there were various 
 things
 What -- the Federal court could -- is -- is being asked to increase somebody else's taxes
 That's a very strange notion
 But what could the State court do? The same case in State court -- and let's assume there 
is a constitutional violation, either the Commerce 
Clause or the equal protection
 What could the State court do that a Federal court couldn't? MR
 MIZER: I think there are three options available to the State court
 First, it could decrease the -- the taxes on the challengers, even if they don't 
ask for such a decrease
the taxes on the local distribution companies, or they 
can do what the Ohio Supreme Court has done in the 
education context, for example, which is to declare 
unconstitutionality and then leave it for the General 
Assembly, the Ohio legislature, to fix the problem and 
then come back with a remedy
 If -- if that kind of relief were ordered by the Federal court, it would mean Federal court oversight 
essentially of Ohio budgetary processes, which this 
Court has repeatedly discouraged
 JUSTICE ALITO: May I come back to your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question? Would it be beyond the ability of the Arizona courts, had that case  
 been -- had Hibbs been brought in Arizona, to hold that 
under whatever principles of severability Arizona has, 
the tax credits for some private schools could not be 
stricken without striking the entire provision? MR
 MIZER: I think the entire provision would have to be stricken in Hibbs because of the nature 
of the as-applied challenge there
 They were saying that all the money was going to private schools, private 
religious schools
 JUSTICE ALITO: The point is that -- that one possible -- if there was an Establishment Clause 
violation, one remedy would be to prohibit credits for 
payments made to religiously affiliated schools, but 
allow the credits for other private schools
 But under principles of severability, couldn't an Arizona court 
say that can't be severed from -- from allowing the 
credits for payments to secular private schools? MR
 MIZER: That's probably right, Your Honor, and the -- what it illustrates is that often 
State courts have available to them remedies that 
Federal courts may not, particularly when plaintiffs 
have pleaded the case in such a way as to tie one hand 
behind the Federal court's back
 JUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't that suggest Hibbs should have come out the other way?  
 MR
 MIZER: Well, to be frank, Your Honor, the State of Ohio joined an amicus brief urging the 
opposite outcome in Hibbs
 But we are not urging the overrule of Hibbs here
 We think that, even on Hibbs' own terms, the Tax Injunction Act applies here to 
preclude this challenge in Federal court
 And to return JUSTICE KENNEDY: If -- just one more
 If the remedy is likely to be we will leave it up to the 
legislature -- you had -- you had two or three different 
optional remedies -- would we say that that is an 
adequate State remedy? MR
 MIZER: Yes, I believe so, Your Honor
 Because so long as the challenger would be able then to 
-- to seek some sort of contempt action if the -- if the 
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Contempt of the legislature? Contempt did you say? MR
 MIZER: Of the -- of the tax commissioner
 If the tax commissioner is continuing to collect unconstitutionally unbalanced taxes, then I 
should think that there should be some enforceability 
there
 But the adequacy of the challenge available is -- is measured, as this Court explained in Rosewell, 
 purely by procedural measures
 And so for -- in Rosewell the question was whether or not the parties 
could go to State court and would procedurally be able 
to get access to State court to resolve their claim and 
that is clearly true and no one contests that here
 The -- to return to Justice Sotomayor's question about the -- the racial cases, that may seem 
troubling, if a racial challenge is excluded from 
Federal court, but -- but there is no doubt that State 
courts can resolve such claims and in fact the Ohio 
Supreme Court handles tax cases as a routine matter
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is -- the cases running up to Hibbs, those were all cases that involved 
racial discrimination, and they were in the Federal 
courts
 MR
 MIZER: in every case that we have examined one of two things 
was true: Either the party was claiming standing not based on the fact that he himself was subject to 
unconstitutional taxes; or the party was not -- did not 
have an adequate remedy in the State court
 For example, in the Griffin case this Court said that the 
problem was that in Virginia nothing was being done to 
remedy the -- the unconstitutional burdens imposed 
there
 And so the lack of an adequate remedy both under  
 the comity doctrine and under the Tax Injunction Act 
allowed the plaintiffs there access to the Federal 
court
 And so the comity rule that we are advocating, which is clearly laid out in both Fair 
Assessment and Great Lakes, would not have any effect on 
those cases because of the lack of an adequate remedy
 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything -- I see in their complaint, they ask for "such other relief to 
which plaintiffs are entitled," and therefore the judge, 
despite what they say, might just say: Well what you are entitled to is you are entitled to pay fewer taxes
 Is that a plausible thing, in which case it would interfere with the revenue collection of the 
State
 MR
 MIZER: JUSTICE BREYER: you better give me your accurate assessment, not just 
agree with me, because I would like to know what you --
I want to know both sides
 MR
 MIZER: The Tax Injunction Act would bar the Court, I think, from entering an order that says the 
taxes on the challengers are decreased, which 
illustrates the reason that the State of Ohio with its 
 
 JUSTICE BREYER: But I have no idea -- why I am asking the question is I have no idea or little idea 
of the underlying State law merits
 And my suspicion is in about  or  minutes I will hear that the State law 
merits are such that it's virtually impossible that they 
are going to say to us: Pay fewer taxes
 Rather they will say to our competitors: Pay more taxes
 So now is your chance to reply to that hypothetical argument just 
in case they make it
 (Laughter
) MR
 MIZER: Well, first of all, Your Honor, the -- the merits of this case are very much like the 
merits of General Motors Corporation v
 Tracy, which this Court decided about  years ago
 But the merits 
that would be ordered in this case, because if it's so 
simple as the Federal court simply saying that the local 
distribution companies, the public utilities, now must 
pay the sales tax and the commercial activities tax, 
then suddenly those entities would be subject to five 
taxes, a -- a much greater burden then is imposed on the 
Respondents
 And then the General Assembly would have to go back to the drawing board to adjust the taxes on the 
local distribution companies
 So even if the simple 
 remedy that they ask for is entered by the Federal 
courts, still the State of Ohio has to respond by 
readjusting its sales tax and its commercial activities 
tax; and in that event it first of all could easily end 
up in a net revenue loss for the coffers of the State of 
Ohio
 It also would mean that the regulatory side of thing would be affected, which brings us back to the 
Burford principles we discussed earlier, because the 
taxes, as I said, are integrally connected to the way 
Ohio regulates public utilities
 And those public utilities have obligations to a captive market that the 
Respondents don't have to meet
 They serve customers in their area no matter what, whereas Respondents don't 
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but this -- but this doctrine, I -- I am not very sympathetic to that 
argument because this is a doctrine that is directed to 
the State collecting taxes, not to interfering with 
State regulation
 That -- that's a different doctrine
 MR
 MIZER: But Your Honor, I think that Great Lakes and Fair Assessment stand for the 
proposition that when a Federal court issues an order 
that invalidates a State tax law, that has a disruptive 
effect on the collection of taxes; and that would be  
 true here because the State of Ohio would no longer be 
able -- would not be able to collect five different 

turning around and facing a new challenge on -- on 
unconstitutionality of that burden by the local 
distribution companies
 And so the -- the complicated nature of the tax-regulation interplay here is all the more reason 
that this case belongs in State court, for the State 
courts to resolve those interconnected questions in ways 
that they are fully equipped to answer
 The other factor that was relevant to the JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just a little puzzled
 I think you are giving the State court an awful lot of 
power
 Can it do it without new legislation? They have to adjust these other taxes, maybe the expenses they 
deduct in their regulatory filings and all the rest
 
But I don't know that the State court has any more 
authority to grant a judicial remedy than the Federal 
court would have
 MR
 MIZER: The State court might be able to enter a remedy, Justice Stevens, that is so simple as 
enjoining the sales tax exemption and the commercial 
activities tax exemption for local distribution  
 companies, and then also saying that because the LDCs 
have to pay those taxes they no longer have to pay the 
gross receipts tax and the other two taxes that are 
imposed on them
 That's an order that the Federal court couldn't issue because under principles of both the Tax 
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the Tax Injunction Act goes to the authority or the jurisdiction of the court 
to entertain the case in the first place
 I'm not sure the Tax Injunction Act prohibits the remedy that you 
describe, because there is a difference between filing 
the suit and entering relief after the suit's been 
filed
 MR
 MIZER: With respect, Your Honor, I think that Great -- that Grace Brethren squarely stands 
for the proposition that a Federal court shouldn't enter 
an order that says that the State tax law is -- that 
declares the State tax law unconstitutional and then 
enjoins it
 And that is exactly what would be required in order to eliminate the additional taxes on local 
distribution companies
 And that analysis is done at the front end, not at the end after the Court has 
resolved the constitutional merits and then says, well, 
I guess I am not able to enter the order that makes the 
most sense here to resolve the constitutional question
  
 If there are no further questions I would like to reserve the balance
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 Mr
 Fitch
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN C
 FITCH ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS MR
 FITCH: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Breyer, if I can go directly to your question with respect to standing
 Standing has never JUSTICE BREYER: That's all right
 It's in the jurisdictional amount
 MR
 FITCH: I understand, Your Honor
 But because it has never been raised
 I do not have a good answer for you
 What I can say to the Court is that in Hibbs -- recognizing Hibbs was an Establishment Clause 
claim -- the Court struck down the credit
 There is a recent case out of the First Circuit in Coors where 
Coors reversed their prior case out of -- involving the 
Butler Act out of Puerto Rico, and that involved beer 
distributors challenging a credit or an exemption that 
JUSTICE BREYER: They might want to -- in all the Court's cases, the challenger wanted -- he said: 
 I don't care; either make them pay or give me my money back
 MR
 FITCH: JUSTICE BREYER: So that -- that should be your case, I would have thought
 But you're not saying it so you can get into Federal court
 Now, that's how I read it
 And that seems -- that's worrying to me
 MR
 FITCH: Well, Justice Breyer, so -- what JUSTICE BREYER: The Establishment Clause, I would add, there is a lot of reason for thinking it's 
special in respect to standing, because there is no 
other way to challenge the Establishment Clause
 And that is a long-festering disagreement within this Court, 
but I'm not sure you can apply these rules to everything 
else
 MR
 FITCH: And I understand that, Your Honor
 And I guess the point that I'm trying to make is because that issue was not raised, based upon Hibbs, 
based upon the decision in Coors, we did not see a 
standing issue based upon this competitive situation 
you're talking about
 If in fact that is an appropriate question for additional briefing, we would obviously 
welcome that opportunity
 JUSTICE BREYER: But you see what is  
 worrying me
 What's worrying me is, is there are businesses all over the country and there's Federal tax 
law, too
 And suddenly people begin to think: Hey, this is a terrific idea; I am going to go through my 
competitor's tax returns and I will discover taxes they 
should have paid but didn't, and all of a sudden we will 
face a lot of lawsuits challenging other people's taxes
 
That's what is worrying
 MR
 FITCH: Okay
 And I would disagree with you, Justice Breyer, for this reason
 There are already substantial limitations on when this type of case can be 
brought
 We start with the TIA
 we can't restrain the collection of taxes
 We have the abstention doctrines that have been mentioned
 We have the fact that the Court in a merits situation has to 
give deference to the States
 And so the point I'm trying to make is that we believe this is a very narrow window
 There is only a very narrow window open
 What we are doing is challenging an exemption granted to a competitor
 JUSTICE BREYER: And this is not true of the other cases
 What do you think of the other half of their argument? I'll have to think about the standing thing to see if I want to press it or not
 But the other half is: Look at your case
 Your case would just  
 be like -- just like the other cases, if you just said: 
Give us a refund, as they did in the other cases
 But you haven't said that, because that would run afoul of the Tax Injunction Act
 Rather, what you have said is: Raise their taxes
 So the point of the State is: Now, wait a minute
 Leaving all of the things aside, you asked for other appropriate relief, 
and it's highly probable in such situations that a Court 
could -- would say: Give them the exemption
 And if it's going to say, give them the exemption, hey, this is 
now not within Hibbs
 So what's your response to that? MR
 FITCH: Your Honor, I don't -- as my friend Mr
 Mizer said, I don't believe a court could 
say: Give them an exemption
 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? MR
 FITCH: It would be in violation of the TIA
 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no
 There's a lot of MR
 FITCH: It would interrupt -- interrupt -- it would impede the collection of taxes
 JUSTICE BREYER: Of course
 Of course
 Absolutely right
 That's what worrying me
 That isn't the answer
 That's the question
 it's what Justice Kennedy said in respect to  
 discrimination problems
 Usually, either remedy is at issue
 You can't control the remedy because you asked for all other appropriate relief
 Ergo, it falls afoul of the Tax Injunction Act
 What's your response to that? MR
 FITCH: And I -- I'm -- I'm sorry, Justice Breyer
 We are saying that if we ask for the other relief, if we ask for us to get the exemption, 
that would impede State taxes
 JUSTICE BREYER: You didn't ask only for the other relief
 You asked for such other relief to which plaintiffs are entitled
 And what they say -- now I repeat the argument
 Okay
 MR
 FITCH: We did include that phrase
 The relief we are seeking, Your Honor, is the declaratory 
relief and injunctive relief that we have spelled out 
with respect to the exemption
 JUSTICE SCALIA: JUSTICE GINSBURG: JUSTICE SCALIA: I think your answer is that relief that would violate the Tax Injunction Act is not 
appropriate relief
 MR
 FITCH: That's correct, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SCALIA: And therefore not covered  
 by your plea
 MR
 FITCH: And that was not what we were seeking
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Makes sense to me
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there's another little problem
 Do you know of any case where a benefit that A enjoys is taken away from A in a suit where A is 
not a party? I mean, you are fighting the Ohio tax commissioner
 You want to take a benefit away from these LDCs, but they are not in the suit
 isn't there a little due process problem with that? MR
 FITCH: The response, Justice Ginsburg, is this
 Number one, in part it takes away a tax benefit from the LDC; in part it takes away a tax 
benefit from the customers of the LDC
 I know that doesn't make us any more sympathetic
 But the sales tax is paid by the customer
 Now, with respect to the joinder of necessary parties, the motion that was filed by the 
State, which started all of this  years ago after a 
complaint, also included a motion to dismiss for failure 
to join necessary parties
 That has also never been addressed
 We responded to that
 The court decided not to refer to it
 We made an argument that it was not necessary in this case to join the LDC's
 The Court has  
 deferred and did not rule
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was that argument? That you're taking a benefit -- you're saying: The only relief we want is to take this benefit away from people 
who are not in the lawsuit? MR
 FITCH: Well, our argument was simply, Your Honor, that we are challenging the exemption issued 
by the State
 If the -- two points, quickly
 If the LDCs -- at that time, four; now two -- were -- wanted to 
be involved, they could certainly move to intervene
 
The second point was if the Court, of course, ruled that 
they were necessary parties, then we would have the 
opportunity to adjoin them
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in Hibbs, were all the beneficiaries of the provision that was challenged 
MR
 FITCH: I'm sorry? JUSTICE ALITO: In Hibbs, were all of the beneficiaries of the provision that was challenged 
parties in that case? MR
 FITCH: They were not, Your Honor
 They were not
 JUSTICE ALITO: Was there a due process problem there because of that? MR
 FITCH: I cannot identify a due process  
 problem there, Your Honor
 There is an issue that has been raised by several of the justices I'd like to 
address, I think Justice Stevens in particular, with 
respect to: What if this went to State court? And I would disagree with my friend
 If this went to State court, we believe that under State law in the education 
cases that Mr
 Mizer were referring to
 It's called the Duroff case, and we have the citation if the Court would 
like it
 What the Court said was, once we declare the matter unconstitutional, our job is at an end; that it 
had to go back to the legislature
 We challenged the proposition raised in the amicus brief and raised today, 
the notion that if this was in a State court, that a 
State court could go rewrite this statute
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You conceded -- I'm sorry
 You conceded below, to quote footnote  of the opinion below, that there is an adequate State court 
remedy available
 MR
 FITCH: In State court
 We conceded that we could bring this action in State court
 We could seek the injunction in State court
 We could seek the declaratory judgment in State court
 But when we speak to remedy, the point that we are trying to make, 
Your Honor, because it is the remedy where the Federal 
court interference becomes the greatest
 What we are  
 saying is: We do not believe a State court has necessarily brought our remedies
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are claiming that the Federal court could only power -- only power would 
be to declare it unconstitutional and send it back the 
State legislature to decide what to do? Or you are claiming the Federal court has a power the State court 
doesn't have, which is to order the exemption to be 
rescinded? I'm not sure what your point is
 MR
 FITCH: Okay
 The point, Your Honor, is this: We believe the Federal court and the State court would have the power to declare under the dormant 
Commerce Clause and Equal Protection Clause, that this 
exemption is unconstitutional, that either court could, 
at that point, enjoin prospectively the operation of 
that exemption
 The question then becomes: What happens then? JUSTICE BREYER: So then, in your opinion, your next-door law firm, next to you, brings a case and 
says: Mr
 Fitch should pay $, more taxes next year because he deducted $, that was illegal
 You see that? You see? Now I'm trying to bring it home
 There is something wrong with this picture, and I can't quite 
put my finger on it
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Your next-door neighbor has  
 to be a competitor of yours before it would be an exact 
parallel, right? MR
 FITCH: I believe that is correct, Justice Scalia
 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, your next-door neighbor in your business, which would be a competing 
law firm
 MR
 FITCH: Yes
 Yes
 But if I can try to JUSTICE BREYER: But they don't actually bring you into the case
 (Laughter
) MR
 FITCH: If I could try to bring that point home, Justice Sotomayor
 What we say is we are asking the Federal court to rule on the 
constitutionality on our Federal claims, enjoin this 
exemption and the court's work is at an end at that 
point
 What we believe will happen at that point is that the legislature will be faced with a choice
 How JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why should -- why should the Federal court make that choice? in the Federal cases where extension versus invalidation 
has come up, those were all Federal laws and the court 
said in the interim, we are going to extend the benefit,  
 we are not going to take away benefits from anyone
 
Every one of those cases they extended a benefit 
until -- unless and until Congress acts, but there was 
some comfort there because they were dealing -- the 
Federal court is dealing with Federal legislation
 It seems to me that -- that there is that choice, the State courts are much better equipped to say 
what should happen in the interim until the legislature 
acts
 MR
 FITCH: We do not believe that the Federal court could extend that benefit
 I think we are in agreement there, Justice Ginsburg
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The State court could
 MR
 FITCH: We questioned whether the State could
 We questioned whether if the State court found it constitutional, whether under Ohio law the State 
court could extend that benefit
 We think this is a legislative issue
 And there is a point I need to make, because in the briefs and in the argument today you are 
saying there are two choice
 The two choices are you either extend the exemption to everyone or you eliminate 
the exemption
 I need to make this point tying into Mr
 Mizer's comments about regulation
 There is another option which is the regulatory option
 What we are  
 dealing with here is our utility mandate
 It may be that the legislature opts on a regulatory basis to 
eliminate this problem and that goes to footnote -- the 
JUSTICE STEVENS: another problem for me
 Your basic standing is similarly situated competitors, one is being taxed and 
the other is not
 But you are not similarly situated competitors because they are regulated utilities and you 
are unregulated
 Isn't that right? MR
 FITCH: No, Your Honor
 No, Justice Stevens, that's -- that is not correct and that is the 
whole basis for our filing this complaint, if you looked 
at the complaint
 That is what the Court said in General Motors v
 Tracy
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right
 MR
 FITCH: And what our -- what our complaint lays out is sea change of change, we have gone 
from a regulated situation to essentially an unregulated 
situation on the gas commodity piece
 There are two pieces
 There is delivery, there is gas commodity
 The gas commodity piece has been essentially deregulated and 
that is what the Court was focused on in Tracy
 What our complaint very clearly lays out is we believe there has been a change, a factual change in  
 circumstance that will result in a different ruling in 
Tracy
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, I -- I hate to introduce another procedural glitch into this thing, but 
as I -- as I understand it, the State's motion to 
dismiss was under -- under (b)(), which is a motion 
to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and 
that was granted by the court
 The TIA is assuredly a jurisdictional statute, but I had never thought that the 
comity doctrine was a doctrine of jurisdiction
 In fact, by -- almost by definition it says the court has 
jurisdictions but nonetheless should decline to exercise 
any
 You didn't make that objection, though
 MR
 FITCH: I'm sorry, Your Honor? JUSTICE SCALIA: You did not make that objection
 MR
 FITCH: We did not -- we did not make that objection, I do not believe
 That is the entire discussion of Justice Brennan in his concurring opinion 
in Fair Assessment, and we think it is an -- an 
extremely important point
 The district court has jurisdiction in this case
 It has jurisdiction
 The question is, does comity -- should comity tell it not to use that 
jurisdiction
 And what we are really fighting about  
 here is what are those standards that a district court 
is going to use to decide whether to -- to use comity to 
not exercise that jurisdiction
 And what we are saying -- what we are saying in our case is Hibbs did address comity
 The issue was before the Court in comity and Hibbs said, and now four 
circuits have followed that ruling in Hibbs as well as 
lower courts and have said, if you are not seeking to 
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's because there was only one way to go
 Either the benefit is removed or it's not
 There wasn't the other possibility of decreasing the taxes on your client
 There wasn't an extension versus invalidation
 It was if the constitutional claim was good, it had to be invalidated, 
the credit had to be invalidated
 MR
 FITCH: And -- and I think what we are trying to say, Justice Ginsburg, in our -- in our case 
is we are not trying to seek invalidation
 we are not going to seek the benefit for us
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It is not up to you to make that decision, if the State can go either way
 I mean in the extension versus invalidation cases this 
Court made it very clear, you could go one way or the 
other, and that was a decision for the court to make,  
 not the litigant
 MR
 FITCH: But, Your Honor, the point we are making is that some court somewhere has to make the 
decision whether this exemption violates the dormant 
Commerce Clause in the equal protection case
 And it was our judgment that the best forum for that was in 
Federal court
 And again, and I -- and I -- if I am not responsive to your question, I apologize, but what we 
are saying is that, we want to reach the merits on that 
question of constitutionality
 And once that is done, the remedy is going to lie with the State
 We are not going to ask the Federal judge to decrease our taxes
 We question whether a State judge could decrease our taxes
 We want that declaration and we want that injunction
 That's what -- that's what we are seeking in this case
 And JUSTICE ALITO: Do you -- do you recognize that comity is broader than the Tax Injunction Act, and 
if it is, how do you justify your argument that would 
essentially limit the comity doctrine to the contours of 
the Tax Injunction Act? MR
 FITCH: Justice Alito, what the court has said, not only this Court but the First Circuit said  
 in Coors, is what the Sixth Circuit says is that comity 
extends broader than the TIA
 What they point to repeatedly is Fair Assessment, because Fair Assessment 
got damages and it was on a comity basis that the Court 
held in Fair Assessment that you couldn't get around 
your own liability by bringing a damage claim
 So there's one example
 We believe to some extent, National Private Truck Council is an example
 Because in National Private Truck Council, recall we are dealing with a 
State court action, not a Federal court action
 In a National Private Truck Council what the court held was 
under , a State court -- a -- a -- a Federal court 
would not order -- a State court was not obligated to 
grant injunctive relief to grant attorneys fees under 
, and that was based on comity
 In that case there was still an issue of tax collection and impeding tax collection, but certainly 
that appeared to us to be at least an example of where 
comity would be brought in to TIA, because the TIA 
didn't apply in -- in National Private Truck Council
 There was reference to Burford before, as Justice Scalia mentioned
 This is not an abstention case
 There is no question of State law that has to be interpreted here
 There is no doubt who pays the tax  
 and who doesn't pay the tax
 There is no doubt who is an LDC and who is not an LDC
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just go back to my question before
 I understand your point about regulation and nonregulation, but -- but your 
competitors are subject to a different taxing regime 
than you are; is that correct? MR
 FITCH: They are, Your Honor
 JUSTICE STEVENS: And isn't -- is not the reason they are subject to a different tax regime is 
historically they were in regulated utilities? MR
 FITCH: To -- to -- to some extent I believe that's correct, Justice Stevens, but my response 
would be this: If we want to get into them, what taxes do they pay, versus what taxes do we pay -- that's a 
merits question
 That's a merits question
 Is this a compensatory tax? I mean, have we made our case -- do they have a defense because they pay 
different taxes than we do -- that we do, and therefore 
the State should be permitted to do that? We would like to reach that question
 But that's a merits question, that's not a -- not a jurisdictional question
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you don't think that the very question of what taxes you compare and don't 
compare is a matter of interpreting State law? You  
 don't think that the meaning of State law in terms of 
what is comparable or not, is not implicated by any of 
these questions? MR
 FITCH: We -- we believe it is not, Justice Sotomayor
 You can -- you can look at the taxes and see who they apply to
 It -- it is not a matter --I -- I strongly disagree with -- with my counterpart
 
This is not a matter of interpretation
 And one of the justices asked the question about, was extension -- was 
Pullman -- was Pullman ever raised? Pullman was never raised
 My recollection is that in the original motion, they raised Younger, but they quickly dropped Younger 
because there is no, you know, pending State -- pending 
State proceeding
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the other view was the Federal court should abstain
 Abstention doctrines are not the most easy to grant, so -- but they did bring 
up abstention
 MR
 FITCH: Well, but -- very early on they raised it
 They dropped it
 It was -- it was not followed up on, Your Honor
here's the point we are trying to make, as we see it
 
We believe the footnote in Hibbs was correct; in all of 
the Court's prior cases there has been an issue of a  
 taxpayer trying to avoid their own tax and thus impede 
State tax collection
 We read Hibbs to say under the TIA or comity, you are not precluded from original 
Federal court jurisdiction if you are not attempting to 
impede State tax collection
 We do not believe there is any significant 
the case in Hibbs
 As I said, that -- we now have four circuits that have followed that
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When you say that there is no impeding of State court process or taxes, because 
neither a Federal or State court could order the 
MR
 FITCH: That -- that is correct, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That is -- even though the practical consequence is that that is a remedy that 
the State could choose, or must consider
 MR
 FITCH: It -- it could, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That wasn't an issue, however, in Hibbs
 MR
 FITCH: That -- that's right
 And the line that is repeated in a number of cases is, the net  
 effect, whether you are talking about the credit in 
Hibbs or whether you're talking about the exemption in 
our case, is if the Court puts on that order and the 
legislature does not come up with a remedy, is that the 
State would have more money
 In fact it is a question to us, why -- since we have chosen to limit our remedies 
JUSTICE BREYER: Or why isn't this a Hibbs? You read the -- clearly the other side says to read the 
footnote, not as destroying the comity principle
 You know, this is right on the merits
 It still exists, comity
 And you say a strong case for withholding the -- the Federal court's jurisdiction on grounds of comity 
or withhold -- not hearing the case, is the natural 
remedy -- which is to give you a refund -- is available 
in State court
 Go apply for a refund
 No problem
 And that --- and the answer, you know, and then you don't get into all the problem of trying to 
assess somebody else's liability, et cetera
 What is wrong with that, precisely? MR
 FITCH: What's wrong with it, Your Honor, is because what we are trying to do is fix a 
problem
 The question is, are we forced -- are we limited only to seeking a refund? JUSTICE BREYER: Why not?  
 MR
 FITCH: What we're -- because that's not
 JUSTICE BREYER: So not give it -- up to the State? You could say give us a refund or raise their taxes, one or the other
 What's wrong with that? MR
 FITCH: The point that we tried to get across in our brief, Your Honor, is that we are in a 
competitive situation where we are trying to solve a 
problem, the problem of policy that has been adopted in 
JUSTICE BREYER: If doesn't solve the problem for you if you get a refund? MR
 FITCH: It does not
 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? MR
 FITCH: The problem remains
 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? MR
 FITCH: Well, the problem remains because the exemption still exists
 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, no, no, you have it, too -- they -- they work it out, so it equally applies 
to everybody including your clients, so you are all on 
the same footing
 Now what is the problem with that? MR
 FITCH: And I guess we have to be careful with the term "refund," because what I am saying 
is -- is that we are dealing with primarily -- we have 
 three taxes to deal with
 One of them is the sales tax, that's what is paid by the consumer; that would require 
all the consumers to seek, you know, refunds
 It's much cleaner in our view to simply go and get a determination 
whether this exemption was unconstitutional
 We have forgone the --the request for damages, we have forgone request for attorneys fees 
because we have not alleged the  claim
 We are trying to fix a problem
 Justice Breyer, if I can in wrapping this up
 We recognize -- we recognize that this Court has competing interests that it has to weigh in resolving 
this question
 What we are trying to say is that as I said a minute ago, if you put that in context, the 
context is there are numerous protections that are 
already in place for the State to protect them from 
Federal court interference, and we believe that the 
decision in Hibbs and the circuits that have followed 
Hibbs strikes a proper balance for this reason: you -- first of all you protect State tax collection, 
which has been the historic concern of this Court
 
Second, the broad jurisdiction that Congress has given 
in  in a declaratory judgment statute, is harmonized 
with the historic comity concerns
 as this Court spoke in -- in Hertz, just very recently,  
 as opposed to some vague intrusion test, you have got a 
clear test that the Court can apply early on to decide 
whether I got jurisdiction or not
 And finally, the historic right of a plaintiff, which this Court has long recognized -- if 
there is concurrent jurisdiction, the historic right of 
a plaintiff to choose the forum in which to have their 
claims adjudicated is preserved
 If there are no further questions I -- I yield my time
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr
 Fitch
 MR
 FITCH: Thank you, members of the Court
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr
 Mizer, you have five minutes remaining
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN C
 MIZER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR
 MIZER: First off, Justice Scalia's question about the (b)() dismissal motion
 This Court, just a couple of terms ago in the Sinochem case, 
said that the -- that a Federal court can answer 
questions of Younger abstention before answering 
questions of Article  abstention
 And so both of these, both the comity and TIA questions in this case, 
are threshold non-merits questions that can be reached  
 under -- under the Steel Company approach
 JUSTICE SCALIA: All threshold non-merits questions are jurisdictional questions? MR
 MIZER: No
 The point isn't that they are jurisdictional; the point is that in Sinochem -- the 
JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the case you're citing
 MR
 MIZER: It's Sinochem v
 Malaysian --Malaysia International Shipping
 And the holding was JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have a volume anywhere? MR
 MIZER: I don't have a volume number at the moment
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay
 MR
 MIZER: But the -- the holding was the forum non conveniens doctrine can be addressed before 
jurisdictional questions, and along the way the Court 
said that Younger -- specifically said that Younger can 
be answered before Article  standing
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, fine
 It can be answered before jurisdictional questions, but you moved 
to dismiss for want of jurisdiction
 MR
 MIZER:  
 JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and that is not a basis for dismissal here
 The -- the basis is failure to state a claim, I guess, on which a Federal court can 
grant relief
 But I -- anyway
 MR
 MIZER: Well, in any event, Your Honor, we do submit that the Tax Injunction Act and the 
jurisdictional doctrine which would prevail
 JUSTICE SCALIA: That is so -- okay
 MR
 MIZER: And on Justice Stevens' question about the similarly situated or not similarly situated 
nature of public utilities and nonpublic utilities, 
Mr
 Fitch has pointed to the continuing deregulation in 
the wake of General Motors Corporation v
 Tracy
 But as the Ohio Supreme Court just explained in the Columbia 
Gas case that we cite in our brief, that continuing 
deregulation does not change the -- the fundamental 
holdings in Tracy: That when there is a regulatory burden imposed on a public utility to serve a captive 
market, that makes that entity not similarly situated to 
other entities
 And the other point about Tracy and Columbia Gas is that both of those challenges came up to this 
Court through the lower courts, through the State courts 
of Ohio
 And so the State courts are perfectly capable of handling this case
 
 cruise owner, cruise ship owner, and I look at the 
complaint, and I say: I think they really meant me, but -- I think
 Now, within the (m) period, which is the period in which I am supposed to reasonably know 
that I would have been named absent a mistake, here an 
answer is filed, and you are told there is a mistake, 
and you don't correct the mistake
 What conclusion would a reasonable person at that second juncture make 
about whether you made a mistake or not? MR
 BENDURE: I think --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And I think that's what the issue is here, which is, assuming the complaint 
could be read as a mistake during the (m) period, 
wasn't that mistake corrected, and you refused or failed 
to act? MR
 BENDURE: Let me respond both legally and factually
 Legally, I submit that it doesn't make a difference because under the text of the rule if during 
that (m) period they had the knowledge that you're 
suggesting and which would be suggested by the 
Respondent when they say, I think, if you had filed the 
amended complaint and served it a month after the answer, 
it would have been timely, we would have done it
 That acknowledges that there was a mistake, and once there is a mistake, if during that -day  
 period they knew or should have known that it would have 
been brought against them but for the mistake, that 
knowledge doesn't evaporate by later events, as long as 
there is knowledge during that period
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That makes so little sense to me
 Here I think -- and for the following reason: You seriously I don't think could contend that if you had sought to amend a year later, that that would 
have been timely, correct? MR
 BENDURE: Correct
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right
 But putting aside prejudice --MR
 BENDURE: Okay
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what the lower court said was because your delay speaks to a choice, that 
that's the only thing a reasonable defendant would have 
assumed, that having been told that you sued the wrong 
party and you continued in that action, that that's what 
you intended to do, to sue that wrong party
 MR
 BENDURE: Let me point out factually --and I did not stress it in my brief
 The answer was filed on February th
 Twenty-three days later, on March th, the court entered a scheduling order which 
said: You have until the end of June to amend your complaint to add parties
  
 So it seems to me that a defendant faced with a court order that says the time for amendment 
extends till the end of June would not be drawing any 
conclusions that the plaintiff's state of mind had 
changed
 And one difficulty with trying to look at different points during the -day period is that it 
seems to me you'd have a constantly moving target
 If you say that we satisfied (m) at one point in time but somehow that's not enough and at a 
later point in time maybe they didn't know it any more, 
and then perhaps I guess in theory you could have them 
again -- if we had sent them a letter even after that and 
said, you know, we really did mean it, and then for some 
reason they concluded otherwise, you'd have a constantly 
moving target
 And that's --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Bendure, would you explain one factual matter to me? I might have gotten this wrong, but I thought the answer was filed after the 
 year had run
 MR
 BENDURE: It had
 It had
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So when the answer was filed it was too late for you to come within the statute 
of limitations
 MR
 BENDURE: Absolutely true
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I thought that would be 
 the answer that you would give to Justice Sotomayor, because when you got the answer -- which was filed after how many days? MR
 BENDURE: It was filed I think  days after the complaint
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you had gotten that a few days earlier, you could have amended, and then we 
wouldn't be here
 MR
 BENDURE: That's certainly true, Your Honor
 And I think it also --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry
 You have  days to amend, don't you, from the filing of the 
complaint? MR
 BENDURE: No, Your Honor
 The  days is the time frame for the notice to the defendant
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right
 MR
 BENDURE: It --  days after the amended complaint is our time for service of the amended --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Complaint
 MR
 BENDURE: -- complaint on the new defendant
 But I think the point that is raised by Justice Ginsburg is 
this: Once we find out and the limitation period has already expired, school's out
 If we tried to amend immediately thereafter -- if we hadn't made a mistake -- we couldn't 
amend  day after expiration of the limitation period
  
 So if we had acted immediately, we still don't get relation back unless we've satisfied the two 
criteria of the subsections
 But if we do satisfy those within the -day period, then we fall in the safe 
haven provided by the rule whether the amendment itself 
occurs  week,  weeks, or  weeks afterwards
 That --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the basic point is the answer didn't come in until you were already out 
under the statute of limitations
 MR
 BENDURE: Correct
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So from their point of view, nothing else matters; you were out when they filed 
their answer, and you could do nothing to cure that
 MR
 BENDURE: We could do nothing to, as a matter of right, file within the limitation period
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did your amended complaint contain any new and material allegations other than the 
name correction? MR
 BENDURE: It actually was a second count, but it was the same allegations against Costa 
Crociere that had been made against Costa Cruise
 We did not amend the theories of liability
 And, again, getting back to the question of status and theories, I 
think that's the critical distinction between this case 
and the cases they rely upon, Ish Yerushalayim and 
 things like that, where you're changing from an 
individual defendant to an institutional defendant or 
vice versa on a different theory
 And, of course, you couldn't mistake an individual for an institution
 And that I think is the line of demarcation that we™re asking the Court to draw, and it explains 
why in the lower courts the decisions which present our 
paradigm all or virtually all allow relation back; 
whereas, those that seek to amend a change from an 
individual to a corporation or vice versa often don't 
permit relation back
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that the only condition was that it had to arise out of the same event 
or transaction, which would give you much more running 
room than -- than what you assert
 MR
 BENDURE: Only if you™re amending against the same defendant
 If you are adding a new defendant, you have to satisfy (i) and (ii), which look 
to the notice and reason to know of the new defendant
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Bendure, in addition to the mailing of the ticket -- the mailing of the 
ticket came; it said "Costa Cruise" -- were there any 
other connections between the plaintiff passenger and 
Costa Cruise beyond the ticket coming in an envelope 
that says "Costa Cruise"?  
 MR
 BENDURE: There was the -- the pre-suit claims notice which was sent to Costa Cruise at the 
Florida address, in attempted compliance with the 
provision of the ticket which says you must file notice 
to the carrier before filing suit
 And you have to do that within  days
 So we not only got the ticket from Costa Cruise -- we bought it from Costa Cruise -- the ticket 
itself, if you look at I think it's a of the 
appendix to the petition for certiorari, there is a 
prominent page which says "Costa Cruise, cruise company" 
next to a picture of the vessel
 So we have that
 Then when we filed the notice, we sent it to Costa Cruise, we get a letter back from a person who 
claims to be in a position to resolve the liability of 
the vessel over -- owner, signed by him as claims 
administrator for Costa Cruise
 Those are the things -- oh, and then we have, prior to the commencement of suit, the 
Internet investigation about which Florida company is 
registered to do business in the State of Michigan, and 
we look at the Costa Cruise Web site, which says: "Costa Crociere with several offices in several countries, 
United States office, Costa Cruise, Florida
" So those are some of the things which give 
 rise to the mistake --JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr
 Bendure, can -- can I come back to your -- I'm not sure why it matters, but it 
seems to me you™re giving too narrow an interpretation, 
and I would not like our opinion to read any more 
narrowly than the statute allows
 It seems to me that if you assert a different claim arising out of the same transaction, you 
would be able to amend
 If you will look at (c)()(C), which is what you™re asserting here, right? (C)()(C) says, ﬁthe amendment changes the party or the naming of 
party against whom the claim is asserted, if Rule 
(c)()(B) is satisfied
ﬂ Then you go back to ()(B) and it says, ﬁthe amendment asserts a claim or defense 
that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence 
set out
ﬂ It doesn't say it has to be the same claim
 MR
 BENDURE: There™s no question we satisfy that
 Everybody agrees
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that
 That's why I don't understand why you™re arguing a more 
narrow -- a more narrow interpretation
 MR
 BENDURE: Because I™m forced to --JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me you™re home free with (B)
  
 MR
 BENDURE: Unfortunately, (C) then goes on and says: "And if, within the period provided," (i) and (ii)
 So --JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, yes, but -- but those are the only things we -- we have to argue about
 MR
 BENDURE: That's correct
 JUSTICE SCALIA: There™s no doubt that you are asserting -- even if you were asserting a different 
claim, it certainly arose out of the same transaction or 
event, didn't it? MR
 BENDURE: Certainly
 No question about that
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay
 MR
 BENDURE: If the Court doesn't have any additional questions at this time, I™d like to reserve 
the remainder of my time for rebuttal
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 Mr
 Glazier
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S
 GLAZIER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MR
 GLAZIER: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are, we suggest, two issues before the Court: The first is the legal question of whether a plaintiff's knowledge about the identity of the proper 
 party can preclude a finding that there was a mistake 
concerning the identity of the proper party
 That, we suggest, is in some ways the easier issue, because there 
are -- there™s abundant authority from the circuit 
courts of appeal and from this Court in Nelson v
 Adams 
USA, where the Court said the rule requires a mistake
 
In that case, there was no mistake
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Glazier --JUSTICE BREYER: It's no mistake if you happen to know it, if you happen to know who the right 
party is? MR
 GLAZIER: Correct
 And --JUSTICE BREYER: Ever? MR
 GLAZIER: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: Have you ever driven a car where your wife has said turn left and you™ve turned 
right? (Laughter
) JUSTICE BREYER: Has that ever happened to you? MR
 GLAZIER: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: Was there anything you didn't know? MR
 GLAZIER: What the facts are here, Your Honor -- 
 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm asking about this question, my hypothetical
 MR
 GLAZIER: You know --(Laughter
) JUSTICE BREYER: Was there anything you didn't know? MR
 GLAZIER: There is nothing that you did not know
 JUSTICE BREYER: Correct
 Did you do it by mistake? Yes, of course, you did
 It's happened to every human being
 There are millions of instances in which people do things by mistake where, in fact --JUSTICE SCALIA: I think your wife made a mistake
 I don't think you made a mistake
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE BREYER: No, my wife does not make mistakes
 (Laughter
) MR
 GLAZIER: I think --JUSTICE BREYER: I make mistakes, and sometimes I make mistakes knowing all the facts, and so 
do you and so does everybody else
 So I never heard of this thing that you can't make a mistake knowing all the 
facts
 But anyway, here we have a person who didn't know all the facts
 What the judge says is he should 
 have known all the facts
 Where in the record does he say he did know all the facts? MR
 GLAZIER: Where -- in three different times the plaintiff was informed of the facts
 But let me say on the --JUSTICE BREYER: That's a different matter
 My wife told me to turn left and I turned right, okay? 
But I didn't take it in
 MR
 GLAZIER: Well --JUSTICE BREYER: So that's a different matter
 Where does it say that he did know the facts as opposed to he should have known the facts? MR
 GLAZIER: The circuit court refers --talks about imputed knowledge
 We disavow that
 There was no need for imputed knowledge in this case
 What imputes knowledge is someone who does not have 
knowledge
 Courts and lawyers make that up
 If you don't have knowledge --JUSTICE BREYER: I just want the citations to the page
 I wasn't challenging you
 I just wanted the citations to the page --MR
 GLAZIER: There are --JUSTICE BREYER: -- where there™s a finding that, in fact, he knew that this company called "Costa  
 Cruise" in Italian is the same as the company called 
"Costa Cruise" in English? I take it "Crociere" means "cruise
" MR
 GLAZIER: They are -- they're separate corporations
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes
 One is called "Costa Cruise" in Italian and one is called "Costa 
Cruise" in English
 And I just want to know where it says in the record that the client or he, the lawyer, 
actually knew, actually knew that he should have sued 
the one that spells its name in Italian? MR
 GLAZIER: They are separate corporations
 There™s nothing in the record that says --JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't ask you that question
 I'm asking for a record citation as to where there is a finding that this particular plaintiff knew 
that the Italian company called "Costa Cruise" was in 
fact the one he should have sued? MR
 GLAZIER: There is a finding --JUSTICE BREYER: I™ll write them down and look at them later
 MR
 GLAZIER: The finding on page a of the district court opinion says --JUSTICE SCALIA: a of the petition? MR
 GLAZIER: a of the cert petition  
 says "Her failure to timely naming Costa Crociere, S
p
A
 as defendant
" JUSTICE BREYER: I thought what the district court said was ﬁimputeﬂ the knowledge
 MR
 GLAZIER: No
 No, the district court did not impute knowledge, and this is an important 
point
 The circuit court imputed knowledge, and --JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that? Where does it say that on a? MR
 GLAZIER: a -- it's not precisely it, but it says, "Her failure to timely named Costa Crociere 
as defendant was not the result of a mistake
" It does not specifically say --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I -- I know
 I would say in reading this, that both courts have made the most 
elementary mistake of the English language in thinking 
that when a person doesn't know something but should 
have known it, that that™s inconsistent with a mistake
 
That's the very definition of a mistake
 MR
 GLAZIER: Your Honor --JUSTICE BREYER: Now, all I want is some citation from you that shows that isn't what they 
thought
 MR
 GLAZIER: Well, the best I can do is the conclusion that there is not a mistake
 But I -- I need  
 to --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's the conclusion, and when I read two sentences down, it said they may have had constructive knowledge
 The word "constructive" to me, when I hear I want to run out the door, because what the word "constructive" to me means is not knowledge
 MR
 GLAZIER: I™d like to --JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry
 I -- I am not following it
 Where -- where -- where --JUSTICE BREYER: I'm on page a
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes
 But he's talking about constructive notice --JUSTICE BREYER: Constructive notice
 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- by -- by the defendant, not constructive knowledge by the --JUSTICE BREYER: All right
 Then what is --where is the page that it says that the plaintiff had actual, as opposed to imputed, knowledge? MR
 GLAZIER: The -- there -- there is not that sentence --JUSTICE BREYER: Okay
 MR
 GLAZIER: -- in the opinion
 What there is, is the plaintiff made a conscious choice
 The facts of the case are, first of all, before the lawsuit is filed the plaintiff has the  
 ticket
 There is no doubt, no doubt whatsoever, that the plaintiff or her attorney read --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any other than that one page on the ticket, that against the mailing 
envelopes that she got that say "Costa Cruise" -- is 
there anything in the entire record other than that 
definition page that includes carrier, that includes 
steward, anything else that tips her off that this is a 
different corporation? MR
 GLAZIER: There are three different pieces of evidence
 The first is the ticket
 The ticket defines carrier as Costa Crociere
 It is the only entity stated by name --JUSTICE SCALIA: It says it includes stewards
 What do you -- what do you say to that? MR
 GLAZIER: I'm sorry
 I didn™t --JUSTICE SCALIA: It includes the stewards on the boat, according to your -- your friend
 MR
 GLAZIER: It lists one entity by name, Costa Crociere, and lists others by role
 Now, there may be some dispute over whether --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why can't Costa Cruise be perceived to hold one of those roles? MR
 GLAZIER: Well, one might argue that there might be a number of different entities that might  
 be a carrier, but there is only one entity which is 
clearly the carrier, indisputably a carrier
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the relationship between those corporations? MR
 GLAZIER: Costa Crociere is, I believe, one level removed an owner of Costa Cruise Lines
 Costa Crociere operates around the world
 They have different companies that operate as sales and marketing agents in 
different regions
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But are they -- are they sister corporations, a parent-sub --MR
 GLAZIER: No
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- or what? MR
 GLAZIER: Costa Crociere is parent, and I believe there™s a corporation below them, and then that 
corporation owns Costa Cruise Lines
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: When it's below them, you mean it owns all the shares in its -- in its subsidiary 
company? MR
 GLAZIER: Yes
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, the -- the definition of carrier includes independent contractors
 
I mean -- I -- I would -- other than that they are more 
closely related, I can see someone thinking, well, Costa 
Cruise is at least an independent contractor with which  
 Costa Crociere does business
 MR
 GLAZIER: There might be more than one carrier, but there is one carrier identified by name
 
It is the first -- it is the first person listed
 Costa Crociere is the carrier
 I -- I suggest that if one reads the first page of the ticket, one might have 
questions about whether there might be some other 
entities that are carriers, but there is simply no doubt 
that Costa Crociere is the carrier
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if you went to --MR
 GLAZIER: Now, there is no --JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you went to the Web site, which was mentioned, for Costa Cruise, there would be a tab 
that says "Our ships" "Our ships" -- and one of those ships 
is Costa Magica, whatever
 MR
 GLAZIER: Yes
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: "Our ships," and it identifies Costa Cruise as the cruise operator
 That's the information that's given to passengers in the United 
States who are going to book on these ships
 It says Costa Cruise, our ships, Costa Cruise is the operator
 
That's what was being put forth to the public
 MR
 GLAZIER: What -- what -- the relationship between the parties was governed by the ticket
 The ticket says, for example, the claim against the carrier  
 has to be filed within the Southern District of Florida
 
This claim was filed in Southern District of Florida, 
but they did not sue the carrier as identified on the 
ticket
 And the question is was there a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party --JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it shouldn't matter that this confusion was caused in large part by this 
entity that advertises in English under the name "Costa 
Cruise" and identifies Costa Cruise as the operator
 
"The largest European cruise operator" is how Costa 
Cruise is -- is identified in -- in the advertising
 MR
 GLAZIER: We -- we believe that the ticket is clear, and that governs
 But even if one would disagree with that, then we move forward
 If there were any confusion, there™s an answer filed
 Costa Cruise Lines is sued
 Costa Cruise Lines denies that it can be held liable, says it wasn't the carrier, it wasn™t --JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the answer is filed conveniently after the -year period has run
 MR
 GLAZIER: The answer is filed, but the question of whether the defendant knew or should have 
known that there -- it -- it would have been sued but 
for a mistake, the inquiry there is not within the 
limitations period
 It was until the  amendment, which followed the Schiavone case
  
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I don't --I mean, there™s some sharp practice going on here
 
Paragraph  of their complaint sues Costa Cruise Lines 
because -- saying they owned, operated, managed, 
supervised, and controlled the ocean-going passenger 
vessel
 And it's the same lawyer for Costa Cruise as for Costa Crociere, right? MR
 GLAZIER: Yes
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay
 So that lawyer looks at this and says: Aha, they made a mistake; they named the cruise line rather than the name 
in Italian
 So I'm going to wait until the statute of limitations runs, and then a couple of days after, I'm 
going to say aha
 MR
 GLAZIER: The statute of limitations is not the measuring period
 It was before the  amendment
 Now, what happened here is the answer is filed, which makes clear the defendant -- the defendant 
Costa Cruise Lines denies it was involved with the 
ownership, operation, or management
 That's Joint Appendix 
 Joint Appendix --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the answer say the statute -- the -year period has run? Was that raised as a defense in the answer? MR
 GLAZIER: It was not raised in the -- in 
 the defense -- it was not raised as defense in the answer
 It -- it was not
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When was it raised as a defense? MR
 GLAZIER: It was raised  weeks later in a motion for summary judgment, which was still within 
the Rule (m) period, and that is the crucial period
 
If upon reading the answer, which says the --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- the Rule (m) period concerns when you can serve
 It doesn't say that the statute of limitations is any more than what was the 
term of the -- of the passage, was  year
 MR
 GLAZIER: Well, the Rule (m) period is awfully important because Rule (c) turns on, since 
, on the Rule()(m) period
 If during the Rule (m) service period, the -- it became clear to Costa Crociere 
that it was an intended defendant, that it would have 
been sued but for a mistake, then the complaint against 
Costa Crociere would relate back, even though it was not 
timely filed
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, that -- that assumes -- that assumes -- when, what is it, (C)(ii), 
"knew or should have known," it says within the period 
provided by rule (m)
 Now, in the early part of that period, at -- at one point in the period you should have  
 known
 And at another point, because the answer was filed, you shouldn't have known
 MR
 GLAZIER: Well --JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're relying on the fact that they filed an answer which -- I'm sorry --
that -- that you filed an answer which made it very 
clear to them what the situation was
 But was there any point, any -- and all it takes I think is any point 
within that (m) period -- when you -- you knew or should 
have known? MR
 GLAZIER: The answer, we submit, is no
 When they filed the complaint, the complaint indicated a 
couple of things
 First of all, they were suing Costa Cruise Lines, but they had read -- the complaint made 
clear that they had read the ticket
 They specifically relied on the venue provision of the ticket
 So we knew that they had read the ticket, which clearly identifies 
Costa Crociere as being the carrier, yet they still --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where is the defense -- I mean, the ticket says suit must be filed 
within  year of the date of any alleged injury
 And where is the -- that defense stated? You said it comes up  weeks --MR
 GLAZIER: In the motion for summary judgment, which -- which is not in the joint appendix
  
 It's docket entry 
 The affidavit which is -- was filed with the motion for summary judgment is in the --
the Joint Appendix at Joint Appendix 
 And the motion -- the answer made clear that Costa Crociere is 
the carrier which could be liable, not Costa Cruise 
Lines --JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but --MR
 GLAZIER: -- but there was no change
 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- being realistic about it, as I understand it you're relying entirely on 
the condition, general conditions of passage in the 
ticket, the fine print describing the term "carrier
" That's -- but do you take into account that the cover of the ticket, which is what the passenger 
would look at, uses "Costa Cruises," blah, blah, blah --
"Costa Cruise Lines" and so -- and doesn't even mention 
the carrier? MR
 GLAZIER: The --JUSTICE STEVENS: Don't you think, looking at that ticket, if you were a passenger you would think 
you were doing business with Costa Cruise? MR
 GLAZIER: Well, Your Honor --JUSTICE STEVENS: Just looking at the cover? MR
 GLAZIER: If what --JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct that on the  
 cover of the ticket, the Italian name isn't used at all? MR
 GLAZIER: On the cover, the Italian name is not used
 The ticketing agent's name --JUSTICE STEVENS: And isn't that what the --MR
 GLAZIER: -- is Costa Cruise Lines
 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- what the passenger would normally look at, understand who he is doing business with? MR
 GLAZIER: If one were to not read the ticket, which on page  --JUSTICE SCALIA: Assuming -- assuming the lawyer would just look at the cover before he files a 
lawsuit? MR
 GLAZIER: We know -- if this were a question of uncertainty whether the lawyer read the 
ticket, that would be one thing, but we know that the 
lawyer read the ticket
 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't understand what the lawyer reading the ticket has to do with this 
question
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because the question is whether the lawyer made a mistake
 Isn't that the question? MR
 GLAZIER: Well --JUSTICE STEVENS: And he did make a mistake
 MR
 GLAZIER: The principle is if one knows  
 what the true facts are -- if one knows what the true 
facts are and proceeds in any event, then there™s no 
mistake concerning the --JUSTICE BREYER: That isn't true, is it? In the English language, it's not true? I mean, that's why I was giving you some examples
 I don't know; maybe there™s some special legal language somewhere written 
in Blackstone, or maybe it's Lord Coke, I don't know, 
that says when you use the word "mistake" don't use it 
in English, use -- use it in Italian
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE BREYER: But I mean, if we're going to use it in English, there -- it's not hard to find 
instances where a person would know, but he'd still make 
a mistake
 MR
 GLAZIER: Well --JUSTICE BREYER: And there's even a fortiori --MR
 GLAZIER: Your Honor --JUSTICE BREYER: -- if he doesn't know, even if he should
 MR
 GLAZIER: We have --JUSTICE BREYER: Isn't that true? MR
 GLAZIER: What we have up front is the -- the ticket
 If we move past that, it's sort of a  
 test case
 All right, did this plaintiff really not --JUSTICE BREYER: What possible reason is there that somebody who is hurt on a ship and has a 
lawyer, and she has a broken leg, and she'd like to get 
recovery, would deliberately sue the wrong person? MR
 GLAZIER: The plaintiff --JUSTICE BREYER: Is there such a reason? MR
 GLAZIER: The evidence in the record is that the plaintiff's lawyer looked at the Web site and 
chose a United States corporation instead of --JUSTICE BREYER: And I™m just saying, did he do it by mistake? If you were representing this person, would you want to sue the company that could give you 
some money if they are liable? Or would you rather sue the Bank of America that has nothing to do with it? (Laughter
) MR
 GLAZIER: Well, if it were -- if I had to sue Costa Crociere through the Hague Convention in 
Genoa, maybe a lawyer --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I want to ask you about that, because in your brief you refer in your 
footnote on page  to requirements of the Federal 
Government -
 So I looked those up
 I discovered that  says that it is a requirement, and 
you say you follow these requirements, that you shall  
 establish under regulations of the FMC financial 
responsibility
 And those regulations tell you that, at least as best I could read them, that you must furnish a 
written designation of a person in the United States as 
a legal agent for service of process, and they are 
referring to instances in which somebody on a ship 
suffered an accident
 So since you say that you are complying with that, I would like to know the name and address of that 
person in the United States for whom you must send legal 
process, because if obviously that had been on the 
ticket, that is precisely the man to whom this plaintiff 
would have sent the notice
 MR
 GLAZIER: I cannot answer the question now
 JUSTICE BREYER: Well then, were you correct when you said in your -- in your brief that this company 
which you represent does comply with ? MR
 GLAZIER: My understanding is the answer is yes, but I cannot address the specific question
 
I submit --JUSTICE BREYER: It is relevant, I think, because it adds to the confusion if they are under a 
legal requirement to have a service -- an agent to  
 receive service, and then they not only don't do it, but 
they don't have it printed on the ticket
 And they get everybody mixed up by having the same name in English, 
or a very similar one, and announcing someone you™re 
supposed to serve, and then it turns out to be not that 
person you™re supposed to serve
 It's a mysterious person that you can't find
 MR
 GLAZIER: But the question, though --JUSTICE BREYER: It seems odd
 I™d like to know what the explanation is of this
 MR
 GLAZIER: Well, the question is not a more generalized blame explanation, but under the rule, 
the language of the rule, whether Costa Crociere knew or 
should have known that the action would have been 
brought against it but for a mistake concerning the 
proper party's identity
 And the most problematic case -- part of the case for the plaintiff is why, when they were told in 
the answer that they had not sued the proper party, that 
Costa Cruise Lines was not the carrier, was not the 
operator, but Costa Crociere is, why did the plaintiff 
not do anything? JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we -- let's clarify that point now
 I am looking at a, which is the court of appeals opinion, and it says that "Costa Crociere  
 moved to dismiss, arguing that it had been sued after the -year ticket period allowed for claims set forth" -- as set forth in the ticket
 Then the rule tells us that you have this much time to serve, and then the complaint will -- the -- the amendment will relate back to the date of the original filing
 It doesn't change your statement, your defense
 The -year statute of limitations isn't affected
 What is affected is the complaint will relate back if there™s an amendment filed
 But the -year statute of limitations remains, and you didn't 
bother to answer until the -- that time had run
 MR
 GLAZIER: But if -- if, during the -day period -- you know, the Rule (c) happens to 
rely upon the measuring point, but service is not the crucial point
 Within that -day period, if the plaintiff had done anything, anything at all, to indicate that she had not sued Costa Crociere because of a mistake, then the complaint would have related back, a very easy case
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but the relation back is different from the point at which the statute has run
 The statute runs after  year
 Then, if she does what the rules say, it can relate back to the date of the original filing
 The fact remains that you didn't file your answer until after the limitation  
 period had run
 MR
 GLAZIER: Yes
 Yes, we did not file the answer
 They filed the lawsuit on the eve of the --JUSTICE ALITO: Why does that even matter? I'm not really sure I'm following this argument
 Let's say that the answer was filed during the limitations period, and the lawyer -- the plaintiff's lawyer is a solo practitioner, and he or she is out of the office because the lawyer's on a cruise --(Laughter
) JUSTICE ALITO: -- and doesn't come back for  weeks
 And by that time, the limitations period has run
 It's still a mistake
 MR
 GLAZIER: If --JUSTICE ALITO: Where do you see in --the question on which cert was granted has to do with 
imputed knowledge
 Where do you see in the text of this rule anything that picks up the concept of either imputed knowledge or actual knowledge? It just talks about a mistake
 MR
 GLAZIER: We do not rely at all upon imputed knowledge
 The Court granted review, but we don't think there is imputed knowledge here
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, where -- just -- where do you -- where in the rule is there anything that relates to the reasonableness of the mistake? What if it is the most  
 foolish, negligent mistake you can possibly imagine? Is it not still a mistake? MR
 GLAZIER: The rule contemplates by its structure that the mistake will be the cause of the 
reason why the -- the plaintiff did not sue the parties
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That™s not what the rule says
 That™s not what the rule says
 The rule doesn't talk about what kind of mistake or why
 The rule says what the defendant should have known
 And so, when you read this complaint, it's very clear you know 
you™re the carrier
 MR
 GLAZIER: Yes
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You know cruise -- the other line, the sales agent, can't be the carrier, 
correct? MR
 GLAZIER: We --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's either a factual or a legal mistake
 There is no other way to read that other than that there is a mistake
 MR
 GLAZIER: And then --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because -- then have you to answer Justice Breyer's question, which is: What conceivable reason that is not either negligence or 
unintentional or inadvertent or just plain stupidity, 
however you want to define it, that someone who is  
 injured would want to name a party who wasn't 
responsible for the injury? MR
 GLAZIER: The most powerful evidence is simply when they were informed of the claimed mistake, 
they did nothing for  days to indicate in any manner 
whatsoever that it was a mistake
 They had --JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's evidence from which the absence of a mistake might be inferred
 I agree with that, but that doesn't establish that it 
wasn't -- it wasn't a mistake
 MR
 GLAZIER: Well, this -- whether something is a mistake ultimately is a factual issue
 
There™s a legal question of whether a plaintiff's 
knowledge of the identity of a proper party can preclude 
a finding of mistake
 But once we get past that --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But, counsel, don't --what you™re really talking about is whether once the 
answer was filed, they were dilatory in making their 
motion
 I don't understand how you can argue that the day you received this complaint, you didn't understand 
that some sort of mistake had been made
 The day that the answer came in, you might start to have a doubt because of their delay in the 
motion to amend, but doesn't that go to a (a) 
question, whether the judge should have given leave to  
 amend because of dilatory tactics? Isn't that a (a) question, not a (c) question? MR
 GLAZIER: Well, delay in moving to amend via (a)
 But (c) requires the judge to determine whether there was a mistake
 And here, in essence, we have a test case: Well, the plaintiff is claiming that the reason why she did not sue Costa Crociere --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there anything in the face of the complaint that would suggest anything but a 
mistake? Now, forget -- I'm being very specific
 On the face of the complaint
 You read that
 MR
 GLAZIER: Yes, I believe there is
 The complaint specifically makes clear that the plaintiff's 
lawyer read the ticket
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where does it say that? Where does it say: "I know that the carrier is Costa Crociere"? Where does it say that? MR
 GLAZIER: The complaint certainly does not say that
 What --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What the complaint says is that Costa Cruise, the operator of the vessel, 
injured me, correct? MR
 GLAZIER: It says that the --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And is that an accurate statement of fact?  
 MR
 GLAZIER: That -- it's not an accurate statement of fact
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I would have said the previous paragraph, , says: "The plaintiff has complied with all the pre-suit requirements of the 
passenger ticket
" So you know they read the ticket
 MR
 GLAZIER: Right
 And in the paragraph before, venue is proper in Broward County; defendant's 
passenger ticket contains a forum selection
 So we know when Costa -- Costa Cruise Lines, or Costa 
Crociere learns of this, we know that the plaintiff 
decided --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, which is it? Is that a Freudian slip? (Laughter
) MR
 GLAZIER: No
 No, because we™re --because we™re not disputing --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just a mistake
 (Laughter
) MR
 GLAZIER: We™re not -- we are not disputing the notice issue
 What -- what is clear is they have read the ticket, and despite that --JUSTICE STEVENS: Despite that, they made a mistake
 
 MR
 GLAZIER: -- they have decided to sue Costa Cruise Lines
 JUSTICE STEVENS: They made a mistake, right? They read the ticket, and despite that, they made a mistake
 MR
 GLAZIER: No
 JUSTICE STEVENS: What? MR
 GLAZIER: We don't think so
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't -- why doesn't the rule cover it? MR
 GLAZIER: But, again, if we move past --JUSTICE SCALIA: I object to your relying upon the -- the answer as -- as establishing compliance 
with (C)(ii), because (C), in the prologue, says "is 
satisfied, if within the period provided by Rule (m)
" And there is at least some point within that period before the answer was filed
 And if, within that period before the answer, you knew or should have known 
that it was a mistake, it seems to me you lose
 Do you understand what I'm saying? MR
 GLAZIER: I understand what you™re saying, but there™s nothing in -- just the point --JUSTICE SCALIA: And the -- the only thing you could rely on for that short period before the 
answer is filed is simply the ticket, right? 
 MR
 GLAZIER: There™s nothing in the rule --the ticket and the complaint -- there™s nothing in the 
rule that says that only events up to point of the 
running of the limitations period or the service of the 
answer are relevant
 It is throughout the certain --within the period --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you are reading "within the period" to mean "throughout the period
" It doesn't say ﬁthroughout the period
ﬂ It says ﬁif within the period
ﬂ MR
 GLAZIER: Well, the district court, which is serving as the fact-finder there, looked at all 
the evidence
 And the powerful evidence is the service of the answer, which identifies the party --JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's an important issue with respect to the statute
 I don't think we can treat cavalierly whether "within the period" means 
"throughout the period
" That's one of the issues here
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one -- one question about the face of the ticket, the one with the picture 
on it
 Is it Costa Cruise or Costa Crociere that got this big award for ﬁB
E
S
T
 ﬂ? MR
 GLAZIER: I -- I don't know the answer to that
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Pardon me
 
 MR
 GLAZIER: I don't know the answer at this time
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I make the assumption that it's the cruise line, Crociere, that got the award
 So the ticket itself confuses the two companies
 Is that a mistake, incidentally? (Laughter
) 
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I am right, is that a mistake? MR
 GLAZIER: I -- Your Honor -- clearly, as you said, Costa Crociere is the vessel operator
 The ticket makes it clear on the next page, the very next 
page --JUSTICE KENNEDY: How many -- if you have a ,-page ticket, how many pages do you have to read? MR
 GLAZIER: Here, you only have to read one
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But this is the first one
 MR
 GLAZIER: Well, this is --JUSTICE KENNEDY: The one I pointed out to you with the mistake, that™s the first one
 MR
 GLAZIER: It™s -- it™s on the cover
 The ticketing agent here, Costa Cruise Lines, adds the 
cover
 The first page of the provisions say Costa Crociere is the -- is the vessel operator
 But, again, if one looks at the answer, 
 there™s no response
 No response, and then a motion for summary judgment
 Still nothing
 If the plaintiff had merely said in an e-mail or a phone call, hey, I made a 
mistake, then it would be clear
 An easy case
 But they did not act despite being informed
 Despite being informed in the answer of the identity of the proper 
party and in the motion for summary judgment
 The trial court, serving as the trier of fact here on this issue, 
had to make that decision
 Maybe the court with another --JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm still puzzled, because Rule (C) just requires -- describes the state of mind of 
the defendant, correct? C(i) and (ii); isn't that right? MR
 GLAZIER: Yes
 JUSTICE STEVENS: And is it not true that under (i), the defendant did receive such notice of the 
action, would not be prejudiced? That's clear, isn't it? MR
 GLAZIER: Yes
 JUSTICE STEVENS: And is it also true that at the time they received the complaint, they knew or 
should have known that the action would have been 
brought against the carrier instead of the broker? MR
 GLAZIER: The answer --JUSTICE STEVENS: I just don't understand how you get around the plain language
  
 by the court: I hereby declare a mistrial
 I suppose you could have an objection, but it would be very -- the 
jury was present when the judge said: I hereby declare the mistrial
 MR
 McGORMLEY: Correct
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it would be rather awkward for the counsel at that is point
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no -- there was no pause, you agree, between the foreperson's report and 
the court then said immediately afterward: The jury is dismissed
 So there was no interval for an objection? MR
 McGORMLEY: Well, it -- it would be difficult for counsel to object at that point, but I 
still think counsel could have made a record immediately 
at that point
 JUSTICE ALITO: Why would it have been difficult? Why would it be difficult for counsel to say, may we have a sidebar, and say, Your Honor, I don't 
think that there should be a mistrial, I think you 
should ask the jury to deliberate further? MR
 McGORMLEY: Well, that is possible and that as seen in the Webb case as well, where the trial 
JUSTICE STEVENS: What do you make of the fact that in subsequent proceedings the prosecutor  
 acknowledged that the judge made a mistake? MR
 McGORMLEY: In Michigan confessions of error are controlled by court rule as a procedural 
matter, and the appellate courts have the ability to 
accept statements that could be qualified as a 
confession of error or not
 Here the Michigan Supreme Court addressed this case on the merits, the underlying 
double jeopardy merits
 In much the same way, it did not address potential waiver or consent issues by the 
defendant
 So we have a merits opinion here
 JUSTICE BREYER: There are thousands and thousands of mistrials every year and hung juries are 
not all that unusual
 So in this case we have testimony going on for  days,  hours total
 And we have jury deliberation of -/ hours, and we have really very 
little -- I think you can argue it both ways that the 
jury was deadlocked
 There are some things for, some against, only a couple
 And he doesn't consult with the lawyer, all right
 Now, in these thousands and thousands of cases that must be there over the decades, you probably looked 
through a few or at least talked to your fellow bar 
members
 How many have you found where you would say that a mistrial was declared despite facts that are on 
your side? In other words, there are going to be  
 millions of cases, not millions but thousands; many of 
them will support the defense
 Maybe many support you
 But I haven't seen any here that say they support you
 
So how many do? And what do you want me to read to see that this is not an extreme case that counts as an abuse 
of the judge's discretion? How many did you find which will prove to me this is not, this is closer to the 
norm? MR
 McGORMLEY: Well, the difficult part in answering Your Honor's question is that this Court has 
indicated that there is no mechanical formula or test
 JUSTICE BREYER: Correct
 That's why I am asking the question
 What they've said is, is it an abuse of discretion? And they've also said the judge has to be careful
 Okay, so we have like an abuse of discretion scale and this is pretty far over on the 
abuse of discretion side
 I think anyone would admit
 But what cases will show to me that it's on your side, 
not quite an abuse of discretion? Or is this the most extreme case in history? MR
 McGORMLEY: I don't believe it is, Your Honor
 JUSTICE BREYER: I know you don't believe it
 All I want you to do is to give me some evidence, like refer me to some other cases or explain to me how  
 you have come to that conclusion, not on the facts of 
this case, but looking on the scale
 MR
 McGORMLEY: I reach that conclusion by JUSTICE BREYER: I don't want you to look at this Court
 We don't have a case where we said what was an abuse of discretion
 I want you to tell me -- and I've already said this twice, but I am judging from your 
answer you found no case supporting it
 You have found no case in the history of the United States that was 
MR
 McGORMLEY: JUSTICE BREYER: -- where they said it wasn't an abuse of discretion
 That's what I'm judging from your answer
 MR
 McGORMLEY: I have not found a case on these facts with a note indicating acrimonious 
deliberations, that is correct
 JUSTICE BREYER: There is no note indicating
 There are five, there are notes they sent out, and at : in the morning they said: Judge, we have a concern about our voice levels, disturbing
 
That's what they said
 Then they asked to see the evidence and they said: Explain Count 
 Then they said: Are we allowed to break?  
 And then they said: What if we can't agree? Mistrial, retrial, what? And at :, the same time, they said: What about lunch? Then he brought them out and he says to the juror: All right, do you believe it's hopelessly deadlocked? And the foreperson said: The majority of us don't believe that
 And he said: Don't say what you're going to say
 And then he doesn't have the lawyer there
 Okay, that's fairly extreme
 So that's why I ask the question
 MR
 McGORMLEY: But the reference there about don't say what you're going to say is likely a 
reference to don't give the breakdown of your verdict
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr
 McGormley, is it your burden to answer that question? Given AEDPA, is it up to you to show that this case is within the mainstream 
or is it up to the other side to show rather 
conclusively that it is not in the mainstream? I thought that's what AEDPA required
 MR
 McGORMLEY: It is Petitioner's burden
 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is Petitioner's burden to show that there are cases like this, where I guess to 
show that uniformly in cases like this, there is no 
discharge of the jury
 And I'm not aware that they have  
 carried that burden
 But we will ask when they come up
 It is their burden, however
 JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly but I'm drawing some conclusions from your silence
 You haven't found a case supporting it? MR
 McGORMLEY: I haven't found a case on JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have you found any case where a judge has declared a mistrial without conferring 
with counsel, where the declaration was upheld? MR
 McGORMLEY: Actually, there's one out of the Sixth Circuit, Klein v
 Leis, from this very 
circuit, in which the individual -- it was not a 
deadlocked jury case, but the individual had some sort 
of stun or control belt on the defendant and he lifted 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well you can't read from that one, because in that one it was -- the mistrial was 
held, not because of a jury deadlock, but because of 
improper prejudicial actions during the trial
 MR
 McGORMLEY: JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Those are different questions
 MR
 McGORMLEY: But it's still a manifest necessity determination
 In fact, this Court has  
 indicated that on the spectrum of reasons a deadlocked 
jury warrants the least amount of appellate scrutiny
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- yes, but that doesn't mean none
 What -- other than we have cases where judges have declared mistrials because they are going on 
vacation
 Those are easy, okay? But somewhere the word "abuse of discretion" means that someone has discretion, but is improperly 
exercising it
 What facts would it take for you to believe that that would have been the case? What do you 
that would have been an abuse of discretion? What point? If he got the note and declared a mistrial, that would be enough, right? Or would it? MR
 McGORMLEY: Well, to best answer Your Honor's question, I would point out again that in 
Arizona this Court mentioned that examples being of 
abuse of discretion or actions that cannot be condoned 
are when the trial court acts irrationally, 
irresponsibly, or for pretextual reasons
 And in our yellow brief we cited several cases where I would say 

the Starling case in which the jury is giving a contrary 
indication
 The jury in the Starling case indicated  
 that, we are making progress and in fact can we have  
more minutes; and the judge pulse them out and declares 
a mistrial
 Your Honor's example then with the Gordy case would be the imminent travel plans and docket 
considerations
 We also have where the court acts sua sponte, and that's where -- the Webb case, where the 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't that this one, meaning the jury doesn't say, we are deadlocked, 
hopelessly deadlocked, we cannot reach a verdict
 It asks: What happens if we don't? And the foreperson hasn't conferred with the jury to determine whether or 
not as a group they believe they are hopelessly 
deadlocked
 Why isn't this precipitous action? MR
 McGORMLEY: Well, again, as I -- as I mentioned, it's a reasonable view of the first note that 
it is indicative of acrimony
 It's a reasonable view of the second note that it was indicative of a deadlock
 JUSTICE SCALIA: But again, that's --that's not your burden
 We are operating here under a statute which says: "In a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in 
custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a  
 determination of a factual issue made by a State court 
shall be presumed to be correct
 The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of 
correctness by clear and convincing evidence
" Now, what is the factual determination that has been made here? I assume it's the factual determination that the jury was deadlocked
 MR
 McGORMLEY: That is correct
 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that has to be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, correct? MR
 McGORMLEY: That's correct
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't you answer that to those questions
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what is the status of the -- the Allen charge in Michigan? Has Michigan taken a position on whether that's a good thing, a permissible 
thing for a trial court to do? MR
 McGORMLEY: Well, a -- Michigan has adopted the ABA standard
 Michigan has the Instruction 

 It's not what we would call the traditional Allen dynamite charge because it's not asking the minority to 
give credence to the majority's opinion
 So there is a deadlocked jury instruction in Michigan
 It's not the traditional Allen dynamite charge
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that wasn't  
 requested, either? MR
 McGORMLEY: Well, that was not -- that was not done here
 But again, I think it's reasonable, understanding that this is a dual -- dual-layered 
deference case, being a habeas case as well as the trial 
court being -- having broad discretion to make this 
determination, that when you have -- have the notes -- I 
mean, it -- it may tell the -- the trial court may have 
felt that giving an Allen charge when there's acrimony 
may be telling those minority jurors that it doesn't 
matter and that they may have to submit to the majority 
opinion
 So I believe it was -- it was reasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court here, applying AEDPA to -- to 
conclude that the -- the trial court acted in 
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you as a matter of Michigan practice, could the trial judge have 
interrogated the other jurors beyond the foreman and 
asked them what they thought about whether there was a 
deadlock? MR
 McGORMLEY: I believe that is permissible, though not constitutionally required
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any reason -- do you suppose there is any reason why he didn't do that?  
 MR
 McGORMLEY: JUSTICE GINSBURG: She
 MR
 McGORMLEY: JUSTICE STEVENS: He took the view of the foreman, an answer to one question, and that was it; is 
that right? MR
 McGORMLEY: JUSTICE STEVENS: His conclusion that there was a deadlock was based on one question and one answer 
of one of the jurors, and that was the whole record 
supporting his decision; is that right? MR
 McGORMLEY: Respectfully, no, Your Honor
 I believe it was based on the totality of the circumstances, including the two previous notes and a 
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what other circumstance is relevant? The fact that they raised their voices during deliberation, certainly that -- that 
doesn't cut any ice either way, does it? MR
 McGORMLEY: Well -- oh, I believe it does, because this Court has indicated in Arizona 
that -- that acrimony is a concern
 It's a countervailing concern to balancing the interest of the 
defendant having his case decided by a single tribunal 
and fair and just judgments, as well as society having 
 one fair opportunity to vindicate its laws
 So I think it's very much an appropriate consideration
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr
 McGormley, what evidence was there to the effect that the jury was not 
deadlocked? MR
 McGORMLEY: None
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is presumably what the other side has to prove by clear and convincing 
evidence, if -- if we accept the factual finding of the 
State court
 MR
 McGORMLEY: Correct
 That's why it's imperative to view this case in the habeas box that it 
resides
 And that is the Michigan Supreme Court made reasonable factual determinations and did not 
objectively unreasonably apply this Court's precedent
 
And the fact that we may look at these notes and go one 
way or the other means that the State wins
 The State should prevail, because it's a reasonable interpretation 
of those notes
 If one person may say, I don't know that that really indicates deadlock and the Michigan 
Supreme Court is looking at it and it's a reasonable 
determination, then deference should apply and the State 
should prevail
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 McGormley, do we have any indication how long this trial judge was on the  
 bench when this trial came up? MR
 McGORMLEY: How long in terms of serving on the bench? JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes
 MR
 McGORMLEY: My recollection is that this was an experienced trial judge who then went to either 
civil arena from recorder's court or retired
 So I believe this was an experienced trial
 I don't have the exact years
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Acrimony, I recognize we have talked about it in Arizona, but it -- I mean, it 
could be that the jurors had all agreed on the murder 
count and they were just quarrelling over whether they 
should add the firearms count, or the other way around
 MR
 McGORMLEY: Well, it -- it -- it gets JUSTICE KENNEDY: In which case they would be much closer than -- than your comment about acrimony 
might indicate
 MR
 McGORMLEY: Well, it gets back to the fundamental principle that the trial court should be 
able to take -- now, this is on the second, but the 
initial layer of deference -- that the trial court 
should be able to take the foreperson at her word when 
she says that the jury is deadlocked, the jury is  
 deadlocked, especially -- especially in light of 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You can't say, can you, that every time the jury records that it can't reach a 
verdict or it hasn't reached a unanimous verdict, that 
that's a legal deadlock requiring a mistrial, can you? MR
 McGORMLEY: I do not assert that
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So obviously the word "deadlock," and as I read the judge's questions, he 
defined it merely as a disagreement as to the verdict
 
And later he uses "hopelessly deadlocked," but changes 
the question when he asks the foreperson to respond
 Isn't there a difference between hopelessly, i
e
, no further deliberations is likely to reach a 
verdict, as opposed to you can't ever reach a verdict? MR
 McGORMLEY: Well, I guess I don't quite see the difference, because if the jury is in -- I -- I 
think hopelessly deadlocked is probably a higher 
standard than -- than genuinely deadlocked
 JUSTICE ALITO: That isn't what the judge said just before she got the response
 She said: Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict or not? MR
 McGORMLEY: Right
 It's a bifurcated question
 JUSTICE ALITO: And the foreperson said:  
 No, judge
 MR
 McGORMLEY: It's a bifurcated question, correct
 I mean, the -- the first one was regarding confirming the nature of their note, and then, even with 
the interruption, there are -- twice the court 
approaches this inability to reach a unanimous verdict
 So again, here, what is paramount is that it's the Michigan Supreme Court did not objectively 
unreasonably apply this Court's clearly established 
precedent
 There -- there is no case that flatly controls this case, other than the Braun-Perez standard
 
In fact, the Sixth Circuit here created its own 
three-part test, as we've indicated in our brief, when 
they said that there are three considerations that 
determine
 So when you take that three-part test, which is not this Court's holdings and test on habeas, as well 
as the second-guessing of those predicate factual 
determinations being, well, the jury probably didn't 
have enough time to even review the witnesses, juries 
often report themselves deadlocked, we can't give as 
much weight to this foreperson's statement, it's 
contrary to these dual layers of deference
 And if there are no further questions, may I reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal?  
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel

 McCowan
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARLA R
 McCOWAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MS
 McCOWAN: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Habeas relief was properly granted
 I would like to first answer Justice Ginsburg's somewhat easy 
question for me
 Judge Brown was sworn into service on January st of 
 At the time of this trial she had been on the bench approximately -/ years
 We are not disputing her experience as a trial judge
 I do disagree with my friend's contention that the Sixth Circuit articulated any specific test
 
What the Sixth Circuit did was set forth some 
considerations or some guidelines, including the first 
of which, that the court heard the -- heard the opinions 
of the parties
 And that does go a long way, Justice Kennedy, toward the idea that the judge is exercising 
sound discretion
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what would be gained from that? let's say one says yes and the other says no
 You ought to grant a mistrial, you shouldn't
 MS
 McCOWAN: Well, at the very least, it 
 evidences that the trial judge at least considered that 
there were -- that there competing interests and -- and 
debated whether to -- to dismiss the jury, which is an 
extraordinarily drastic remedy
 And instead, our position is that there really is no down side to talking with counsel
 You would be able to have the benefit of the parties' 
arguments
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: in your experience is there usually a clear breakdown 
between prosecution and defense on a question like this? 
My perhaps uninformed view is presumably the defense, if 
they have got a deadlocked jury, they want that to 
continue, because all they need is, you` know, one 
holdout
 MS
 McCOWAN: My -- my experience -- there is a range of things that are going on
 I'm sorry, I can't -- I -- I think it just -- it just depends on a 
variety of the circumstances
 But yes, I think that the case law generally presumes that the defendant does want 
the first jury to deliberate to verdict
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms
 -- Ms
 McCowan, you are -- you are arguing the case as -- as though the -- the 
only question for us is whether it was an abuse of 
discretion by the district judge -- by the trial judge  
 here
 That would certainly be the case if this is coming up through the Federal system and we had a 
Federal trial judge who had made this determination, but 
it is not
 It -- it is coming up from a State court and Congress enacted a statute designed specifically to 
reduce the interference of Federal courts with -- with 
State justice
 And that statute says specifically that where there has been a factual finding by the State 
court, it cannot be contradicted by -- by the Federal 
courts unless it is refuted by clear and convincing 
evidence
 Now, what clear and convincing evidence is there here that there was not a deadlocked jury? MS
 McCOWAN: Well, first, I am not sure that I understand -- I -- I disagree with the -- with 
the premise that -- that there was a factual finding by 
the trial court that the jury was in fact deadlocked
 
The judge acquired or extracted the "no" answer and then 
immediately declared a mistrial
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what was the basis for that declaration of mistrial? MS
 McCOWAN: Well, presumably on these facts it would be that -- that -- her estimation that 
the jury was deadlocked
  
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right
 MS
 McCOWAN: But there is no actual specific ruling
 And instead, what we are focused here on is the Michigan Supreme Court's determination that 
there was manifest necessity, and in the absence of the 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The Michigan Supreme Court's determination is simply a determination of the 
same fact: There was a manifest necessity because the jury was deadlocked
 MS
 McCOWAN: JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that factfinding is implicit not -- not only in what the trial court did, 
but also in the Michigan Supreme Court's decision
 MS
 McCOWAN: My understanding of manifest necessity is that that was a legal determination by the 
Michigan Supreme Court, that there was -- according to 
this Court's precedent, there was manifest necessity
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the jury is hopelessly deadlocked, is there a situation where that 
would not constitute manifest necessity? MS
 McCOWAN: Typically, a genuinely and CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it does get back 
 to the factual determination of deadlock, correct? MS
 McCOWAN: Generally, yes -- yes, I believe so
 JUSTICE ALITO: The Michigan Supreme Court cited four factors in support of its decision: the length of the deliberations in relation to the 
complexity of the case, the heated discussions among the 
jurors, the fact most importantly that the foreperson 
said that the jury would not be able to reach a 
unanimous verdict, and the fact that there was no 
objection by defense counsel
 Is there any decision in this Court that says that under -- that in a case in which those four 
factors are present, that the trial judge may not grant 
a mistrial? MS
 McCOWAN: No, there are no specific requirements
 JUSTICE ALITO: And is there -- could you give us a long list of -- of lower court cases holding 
that in a case where those four factors are present, a 
trial judge may not grant a mistrial? MS
 McCOWAN: Well, no
 But the law does still require that the judge exercise sound discretion 
JUSTICE ALITO: The question is when those  
 four factors are present, why are they not sufficient to 
establish that the judge was exercising sound 
discretion? Unless there is a decision of this Court or perhaps a huge body of lower court case law, saying 
that, no, even when those four factors are present you 
may not grant a mistrial, how do you justify the 
conclusion that you are asking us to draw? MS
 McCOWAN: Well, I -- I under -- I think I understand the question
 I do -- I do recognize that there are no specific requirements, and that in the 
absence of that, that there is nothing specific that the 
trial judge was required to do beyond the exercise of 
sound discretion
 And in this case the judge -- the record does not support that the judge did exercise 
sound discretion
 JUSTICE BREYER: So can -- what -- what is -- looking at -- can you take the converse of the 
question I asked your colleague on the other side, if 
you can remember it? I'll -- do you see what I'm -- on the scale
 I mean, this is a fairly simple case
 MS
 McCOWAN: Right
 JUSTICE BREYER: What is wonderful about this case is there is no disagreement about the facts
 
We could write them in under two pages, just quoting 
exactly the notes and exactly what the colloquy was and  
 note that the lawyer wasn't there
 So there we are
 Now, imagine that in front of you
 it's easier for you to look up the cases than it is for 
him, because you want to find reversals, and all you 
have to do is you look and you try to see when the State 
courts, Federal courts have said there was not manifest 
necessity
 So I have some time
 I will read some cases
 Which ones do you want me to read? And I don't need to read the standard
 I have the standard
 And I don't have to worry about -- I agree with the quotation 
of the statute; you have the burden
 And the question is we have a record of those two pages, and does it 
clearly show that he abused his discretion when he said 
there was manifest necessity? whatever cases you tell me to read, I will read
 But I want to find facts and I'm not sure you found some, either
 MS
 McCOWAN: That's correct, Your Honor
 JUSTICE BREYER: How could it be that there are no cases? I mean really, thousands and thousands of mistrials? MS
 McCOWAN: JUSTICE BREYER: How can it be that there  
 are no cases? Are reversals very, very rare for manifest necessity? MS
 McCOWAN: Well, I -- I -- I did undertake tremendous research, as did my staff, and I 
did not find -- I mean, a short answer is I did not find 
anything that looks even remotely as bad as this
 
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, that's good
 Now, tell me then what did you find? When you say "remotely as bad," then you perhaps found some where contention was 
rejected, or where contention -- what did you find? 
What did you find by way of cases where they said on 
facts as bad as this, or not quite as bad as this, there 
was no manifest necessity? MS
 McCOWAN: Well, I guess the short answer is that --- that there was nothing exactly on point
 I mean, there were -- there were cases where the judge 
acted abruptly and hastily and then there were cases 
where the judge did consider the -- the options of the 
parties
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the -- so the proposition that what happened here is an abuse of 
discretion cannot be said to be clearly established, 
right? MS
 McCOWAN: Well, I don't think that it  
 has to be established at -- at a granular level
 This Court does require still that the -- that the trial 
judge exercise sound discretion in making the 
determination that there was manifest necessity
 And CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have anything like this case that says this would be an abuse 
of discretion? MS
 McCOWAN: Well, I -- I do believe that this case looks something like -- Jorn, which is a 
plurality opinion from this Court, where the trial judge 
acted without warning, acted sua sponte, no warnings to 
the parties whatsoever, and immediately declared a 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the fact that it's a plurality opinion means that it was not clearly 
established by the decisions of this Court
 MS
 McCOWAN: But in Arizona v
 Washington this Court quoted Jorn for the proposition that when the 
trial judge acts irrationally and irresponsibly and 
precipitously, that their action -- that their ruling 
will not be upheld; and instead, sound discretion 
requires that the trial judge act carefully and 
deliberately
 JUSTICE SCALIA: But our -- but our cases  
 have required much -- much more than that, much more 
than referring to a generalized standard that our 
opinions have set forth
 They have required proving that the application of that standard in our opinions 
comports with the provision of the statute that requires 
you to show that the claim resulted in a decision that 
was contrary to or involved in unreasonable application 
of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by 
the Supreme Court of the United States
 Now, our cases don't show that you can simply come in and say, well, it's an abuse of 
discretion standard, that was clearly established by the 
Supreme Court of the United States, and therefore all I 
have to show is that this is an abuse of discretion
 I don't think so
 I think our cases show you have to show that the standard as applied by our cases does not cover 
your situation
 And you don't have any cases like that
 MS
 McCOWAN: Well, I do understand -- well, I guess the best answer that I have for that is that, 
why there are no cases, is maybe because -- I mean, I 
don't know, but what I -- what I came up with or 
theorized is that I think that for the most part trial 
courts understand that this is a tremendous obligation 
that they must exercise sound discretion
 And for the most part for  years this has pretty much worked
  
 JUSTICE SCALIA: That may be
 That may well MS
 McCOWAN: JUSTICE SCALIA: -- which says it's a terrible statute, but there it is
 It says it has to be contrary to clearly established Federal law as 
determined by the Supreme Court of the United States
 
And you are saying, no, it's enough if it's established 
by an unbroken line of lower court decisions
 That's not what the statute says
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your -- your position was that everybody agrees on what the law is: 
If there is a deadlock, a new trial is appropriate
 So there is no question about that statement of the law
 
It's the fact question, was this a deadlock, and up 
until now we have been talking about this, including 
Justice Scalia, under the fact problem of AEDPA; that 
is, have you shown by clear and convincing evidence
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, is it quite correct to say the legal issue is whether there's a deadlock? 
Isn't the legal issue whether there was a manifest 
necessity to take the action? Isn't that the test? MS
 McCOWAN: Precisely, Your Honor
 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the argument is that there was not a manifest necessity shown, even though 
 there was disagreement about whether there was a deadlock, because all deadlocks are not exactly alike
 MS
 McCOWAN: Precisely
 JUSTICE STEVENS: there is one holdout, that means it's a deadlock
 Some people think it -- it might be more
 I don't think the test is deadlock
 The test is manifest necessity
 MS
 McCOWAN: I agree
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you answered an earlier question that I asked -- maybe I'm 
-- maybe it was something I asked your friend, although 
I doubt it, since it would help him -- that the issue 
did come down to the factual determination of deadlock, 
because if there is deadlock then there is manifest 
necessity
 MS
 McCOWAN: I'm sorry
 I though that, when I answered that question, that you were asking if 
typically, if the jury is genuinely deadlocked, does 
that constitute an example of manifest necessity? I'm CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right
 So the case comes down to whether or not this is a case of genuine 
deadlock, right? MS
 McCOWAN: Well, no, I believe that the case ultimately comes down to -- I am sorry if I  
 misspoke before
 I believe that the case ultimately comes down to whether the Michigan Supreme Court 
unreasonably applied this Court's precedent in finding 
that the trial judge exercised -- that there was 
manifest necessity in the absence of the trial judge 
exercising sound discretion
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: with the two layers of deference worked into your 
formulation
 It's not simply whether the trial court erred in the determination that there was a deadlock 
that constitutes manifest necessity; it's whether or not 
there was an abuse of -- of discretion for the trial 
judge to so determine that we review under an additional 
abuse of discretion standard
 MS
 McCOWAN: Well, my understanding of  is that it does take into consideration the contours of 
the underlying constitutional violation, and it still is 
our position that if the -- if the trial judge was not 
exercising sound discretion, that it -- that it can't be 
objectively unreasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court 
to have found that, that that is necessarily 
contemplated by 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't our law clearly establish the fact that the prosecution bears 
the burden of showing there's manifest necessity, and if  
 there is an absence of evidence supporting that burden, 
hasn't been -- hasn't been -- why isn't that the answer 
to the case? MS
 McCOWAN: Well, that certainly sounds fair
 my understanding of the law is that when -- when there 
is an objection by the defense, then the burden is on 
the prosecution
 In this case, there was no opportunity to object
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why is that -- why is that so? If Mr
 Gordon thought that this jury was -to- for acquittal, do you think he would have been 
reluctant to ask for a sidebar and object to the 
granting of a mistrial? MS
 McCOWAN: practically speaking, I think he probably would have 
been reluctant to jump up and -- I mean, this is a 
Friday afternoon and the judge has essentially released 
them for the day
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What does he have to lose at that point? She has made the ruling and that's that there is going to be a mistrial
 The lawyer at that point can say: Your Honor, I object, and moreover, I would like you to give the Michigan version of the Allen 
charge
 Nothing stopped the lawyer from doing that
  
 MS
 McCOWAN: Well, I think just as a practical matter, having the jury hear that the defense 
does not want the jury to leave, the potential for 
prejudice would be tremendous
 And as a practical matter, I think that the parties would have been 
reluctant to do that
 JUSTICE ALITO: Are you really saying that? You're saying that a lawyer in your office defending a 
client who thinks that the jury is leaning, is -to- 
for acquittal, and the judge says, well, we're going to 
have a mistrial and the acquittal is going out the 
window, the lawyer is going to be reluctant to say: 
Judge, may we have a sidebar, and then go to the sidebar 
and object to the granting of a mistrial? MS
 McCOWAN: Well, I -- I'm not sure how we 
 for acquittal
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'm not suggesting that they were or they weren't
 I'm just asking about what defense counsel would do in that situation
 Maybe they are more timid in Michigan than the ones I'm 
familiar with
 I would think that they would not be hesitant to raise an objection if they thought it was 
going to prejudice the client
 MS
 McCOWAN: I certainly would hope so as 
 well
 But here I think that it was all just done just so fast and without warning and truly without any 
opportunity to object
 And so for that reason, I -- I think that the lack of objection really doesn't do 
anything to fortify the conclusion that there was 
manifest necessity in these facts
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what -- I'm sorry
 Please finish your sentence
 MS
 McCOWAN: No
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay
 What other explanation is there for a note saying "Are we being too 
loud," other than that there was some degree of acrimony 
on the jury? MS
 McCOWAN: Well, I don't think that the Michigan Supreme Court even made a specific finding that 
the jury had become -- had completely devolved at that 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, you don't dispute the fact that a note came out saying, Are we 
being too loud? MS
 McCOWAN: Not at all
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what would that indicate other than that there was some degree of 
acrimony? MS
 McCOWAN: I think it just also indicates  
 they maybe they just don't want anybody to hear them and 
they want to make sure that they are not being 
overheard, and that, you know, they have some privacy in 
their deliberations and freedom to, you know, engage 
in a -- in a free debate, as loud as they want to be
 I don't think that there is -- I mean, I suppose what I'm trying to say, however inartfully, is 
that I don't think we can do anything other than just 
take that note at face value
 They send out a note saying: We have a concern that our voice levels may be disturbing the other proceedings
 That's it
 It did JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe that's right and maybe it's wrong, but the State courts thought that 
it was evidence of acrimony, which it could be
 And you say: Well, it also couldn't be
 That may well be
 But we are bound to accept the factual determination of the 
State court, unless you can show by clear and convincing 
evidence that that's wrong
 MS
 McCOWAN: I'm not sure -- I mean, maybe I am just not understanding the Michigan Supreme Court 
opinion, but I don't know that they actually made a 
finding that that was, in fact, evidence of acrimony
 I thought that the Michigan Supreme Court  
 that the deliberations had become acrimonious
 and I think that that's a credible point
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't waste your time
 I will look for it
 MS
 McCOWAN: I'm sorry
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't waste your argument time
 I will look for it
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there is no case in our jurisprudence with identical or nearly 
identical facts, so this is not under the "contrary to" 
prong of  -- of (d)()
 So it has to be under the "unreasonable application
" Particularly for me, what Supreme Court precedent do you think was unreasonably applied, and 
explain how and why? MS
 McCOWAN: I think Arizona v
 Washington clearly establishes the law that the trial judge must 
exercise sound discretion in finding a manifest 
necessity
 And in this case, on these facts, it was objectively unreasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court 
to have found that there was manifest necessity in the 
absence of any discretion being exercised whatsoever by 
the trial judge
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And in that case, one of the specific factors was that he consulted with -- the  
 judge consulted with counsel before making the ruling? MS
 McCOWAN: In this case, that he -- that the trial judge failed? JUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in Arizona
 MS
 McCOWAN: Oh, right
 In -- right, exactly
 In Arizona v
 Washington, what this Court had found is that -- that the judge did exercise discretion; 
that was -- that was evidenced by the judge giving the 
parties an opportunity to weigh in on it
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a little shaky as precedent for -- that -- that was a case that said: The trial judge did right and no double jeopardy for a new 
trial
 But in passing, to get there, the Court said: Well, this case didn't involve that
 But the Court isn't passing on anything other than the trial judge in 
that case didn't violate defendant's right
 MS
 McCOWAN: But I thought that this Court did say that in any mistrial declaration, the trial 
judge is obligated to still exercise sound discretion, 
and a review in court must satisfy itself that, in 
accordance with Perez, that the judge did in fact 
exercise sound discretion in finding that there was 
manifest necessity
 And I think that this case looks different from Washington and may be similar to what was going on  
 in Jorn, where the judge acted without warning, without 
any opportunity for the parties to weigh in on the 
matter, and simply declared a mistrial, which this Court 
found to be irrational, irresponsible, and precipitous
 
JUSTICE ALITO: So are you suggesting that whenever the trial judge abuses his or her discretion in 
granting a mistrial, there can be relief under AEDPA? 
It is clearly established that whenever there is an 
abuse of discretion, relief can be granted under AEDPA
 
It is an unreasonable application of our precedent? MS
 McCOWAN: I'm sorry
 Just to clarify
 You are saying if the trial judge abused -- in fact 
abuses his discretion? JUSTICE ALITO: Right
 MS
 McCOWAN: Yes
 I think that if the Michigan -- on these facts, for the Michigan Supreme 
Court to have found that there -- that there was 
manifest necessity in the absence of the judge 
exercising any discretion whatsoever, that that was in 
fact, an unreasonable application of this Court's 
precedent
 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the standard of review for setting aside a determination of the State Supreme 
Court is exactly the same as the standard of review for  
 reviewing a Federal district court and a Federal court 
of appeals despite AEDPA? We simply look and see whether there has been an abuse of discretion
 If there has, we set aside the State Supreme Court judgment? MS
 McCOWAN: No, I'm sorry
 To clarify, it still has to be whether -- we are looking at the 
Michigan Supreme Court's decision here
 We are in -- on habeas, you are looking at the last reasoned State 
court's opinion
 And if the State supreme court -- the last reasoned court opinion says -- makes an objectively 
unreasonable determination, under this Court's clearly 
established precedent then relief will be warranted
 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's objectively unreasonable, you say, whenever there has been an abuse 
of discretion by the -- by the trial court, right? MS
 McCOWAN: Well, if the trial judge does not exercise any discretion whatsoever and acts 
irrationally, irresponsibly, and precipitously, I 
believe that relief would be warranted, even under 
habeas review
 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's not just abuse of discretion; it's abuse of discretion plus something 
else? Plus what? MS
 McCOWAN: Well, it's -- it's whether the  
 Michigan -- whether the -- the decision under review, 
whether it was an objectively unreasonable determination 
of this Court's precedent
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you -- you do agree that there could be situations where a Federal 
court on direct review would find abuse of discretion, 
and yet a court on habeas under AEDPA would say that 
that has to stand? MS
 McCOWAN: Yes
 And I want to clarify
 I think my understanding is that it's not just whether 
this Court disagrees
 It does still has to be an objectively unreasonable determination
 So it's not just simply whether -- whether this Court or any habeas 
court reviewing it would come to a different conclusion
 
It still has to be objectively unreasonable
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there are a category of cases where a Federal court could look at it 
and say, that's an abuse of discretion, but that same 
court reviewing it under habeas would say you are not 
entitled to relief under AEDPA? MS
 McCOWAN: I think that that is right
 JUSTICE SCALIA: But "objectively unreasonable" is already built into the criterion of 
abuse of discretion
 You don't abuse your discretion if what you have done is reasonable, you know, within the  
 ballpark
 It seems to me you are doubling up here
 I -- I don't -- I don't understand how it works
 MS
 McCOWAN: Well, our argument is that the trial court was not in the ballpark here
 The trial court in this case did not exercise any discretion 
whatsoever, let alone sound discretion
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can you say that? I mean, you may think the discretion was abused, but it's not like he just suddenly announced there was 
going to be a mistrial
 He exercised discretion
 He looked at the note, he asked the question, he's -- are 
you hopelessly deadlocked? Are you going to be able to reach a unanimous verdict? And he was able to rely on the fact that they had previously sent out a note saying, are we being 
too loud, and the fact he knew, -/ hours on a case in 
which there were  hours of testimony
 I mean, I understand your argument that he abused his discretion, but I don't understand the 
argument that he didn't exercise discretion at all
 MS
 McCOWAN: Well, my -- my argument is that the judge was not exercising sound discretion 
because she was not responsibly gathering the facts
 
She reached the conclusion that the jury was genuinely 
deadlocked before she even asked a single question
 She  
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, she asked the foreperson a question
 MS
 McCOWAN: But if I could just back up a couple lines, she received the note saying: What if we can't agree
 And she said: I have to conclude from that, that that is your situation at this time
 So she had already reached the conclusion that they were deadlocked before even asking a single 
question
 And then from there she -- she misdefines, for lack of a better description -- she conflated mere 

that -- that erroneous definition
 And she corralled CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where did -- where did -- I'm sorry
 Where did she conflate the two things you said she conflated, deadlocked and the other thing? 
MS
 McCOWAN: I'm in the petition appendix at page a, where she says -- I'm sorry; at the bottom 
of a
 She said: "I need to ask if the jury is deadlocked? In other words, is there a disagreement as to the verdict?"CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you got to  
 read down further
 She says: "Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict or not?" And the foreperson says "No
" MS
 McCOWAN: But in the absence of an expression of deadlock from the entire jury, on these 
facts in this case, it was unreasonable for the Michigan 
Supreme Court to find that that satisfied the trial 
judge's obligation to exercise sound discretion
 At a minimum, the trial judge is required to responsively 
gather the facts
 In this case, she -- she acted hastily and precipitously and without regard for my client's right 
to have this first jury deliberate to a verdict
 She declared a mistrial at the very first sign of 
disagreement and did not give anybody an opportunity to 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just -- with respect, it's not the very first sign of disagreement
 
Reasonably interpreting, a note saying "Are we being too 
loud" is a sign of disagreement
 And there is another note that comes out: "What happens if we can't agree?" You are making it sound more precipitous than it was
 MS
 McCOWAN: JUSTICE STEVENS: Also you are ignoring the fact the first time the question was asked, do you  
 believe it was hopelessly deadlocked and the foreperson 
said the majority of us don't believe that
 And then CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, no
 I'm sorry
 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- and there is a period, in the opinion of the supreme court after we don't 
believe that
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is not a period on page  of the Petitioner's brief
 Is that a mistake? MS
 McCOWAN: I thought there was a dash
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- dash
 And -- and could the court be concerned that the person was about 
to say, and again with deference to the court, "The 
majority -- majority of us don't believe that" -- that 
the defendant is guilty, that the defendant is innocent
 
Wasn't the judge quite correct to stop her right there? MS
 McCOWAN: Well, it may be correct to stop her right there, but there is other ways to figure 
out exactly what the foreperson was trying to explain
 
And if she was trying to say, well, the majority of us 
think we can keep going, then it was -- it was incumbent 
upon the trial judge to -- to do more
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that exactly  
 what she did? After that he says don't tell me what you are going to -- or don't tell me what you are going to 
say
 I don't want to know what your verdict might be or how the split is or anything like that, are you going to 
reach a unanimous verdict? JUSTICE STEVENS: The foreperson did not immediately answer
 She had to ask a second question, yes or no
 And the foreperson answered for herself but not necessarily for the jury when she said no
 MS
 McCOWAN: I think that's right
 And I CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- how do you know she answered for herself? she can't reach a unanimous verdict by herself
 She is answering for the jury
 MS
 McCOWAN: I -- I think that really at best, though -- given the circumstances of this case, at 
best that was an expression of the foreperson's opinion, 
that the jury would not likely be able -- but that is 
not a statement
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you always have to poll the jury, is that what you are saying is a requirement? MS
 McCOWAN: JUSTICE SCALIA: I am not aware that you would always have to poll the jury, and I could see some  
 real disadvantages to it as a matter of fact
 It perhaps puts more pressure on those who are the -- the 
holdouts, it identifies, in some cases, whose are the 
holdouts
 I'm not aware that that's a requirement
 MS
 McCOWAN: It's certainly not a requirement and we were not saying that it is a 
requirement
 But on these facts when the jury has simply sent the foreperson out to gather more 
information, the trial judge was required to, in some 
way, either -- either assure itself that the -- that the 
jury as a whole did agree with the foreperson's 
JUSTICE ALITO: You don't think it's a fair inference from the note that the jury was stuck? Do you think it's -- it's likely that they were just curious 
and they were rolling along just fine, but they were 
just curious, well, what if it happens after we 
deliberated a little more if we can't reach a -- a 
verdict? We just have a curiosity about that? Do you think that's a fair inference from that note? MS
 McCOWAN: I think all that is fair is that they were just trying to gather more information
 
JUSTICE ALITO: You don't think there's  
 that there was substantial disagreement? MS
 McCOWAN: No, I don't think that that necessarily means that there is substantial 
disagreement
 They might have been having trouble
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms
 McCowan
 Mr
 McGormley, you have three minutes remaining
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL D
 McGORMLEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR
 McGORMLEY: Thank you
 Two brief points
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean Respondent, right? MR
 McGORMLEY: I'm sorry? CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are -- you are the Petitioner
 MR
 McGORMLEY: I'm sorry, it -- it -- I'm sorry, Mr
 Lett -- Mr
 Lett's burden to demonstrate that 
there is clearly established precedent that was 
objectively and unreasonably applied
 To Justice Breyer, your question although not exact fact patterns and that is what I was 
struggling with, I would point in our blue brief to  
 Hernandez-Guardado and Lindsay v
 Smith, two cases in 
which -- circuit cases, granted, but two cases in which 
involved jury deadlocks and counsel was not asked a 
question
 JUSTICE BREYER: so as I'm seeing this case, it isn't that complicated
 
You know, it's pretty clear what the standard is
 The standard is, was the decision of the -- of the State 


that's, you know, like  years ago or something
 MR
 McGORMLEY: 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  years ago when it was something like "sound, careful, exercise patience" -- or 
whatever, "the sound, careful exercise of discretion
" 
They said there was
 And the question for us is, was that reasonable? Okay? I guess if the judge had said, "Hey, we have only been deliberating half an hour and 
the game starts in five minutes, I've got to get 
there -- dismissed," that would be unreasonable
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE BREYER: Objectively unreasonable
 So come as close as you can to that, where they held 
reasonable, and what case is it? MR
 McGORMLEY:  
 can't really set the date until it receives the 
information that it hopes to receive from the probation 
office or from the victim
 So that --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no --JUSTICE GINSBURG: It can say  days
 It can say  days
 MS
 KARLAN: It -- it could, yes
 Or it could say, as the district court did here, I'm going to 
hold open the date
 But it can only hold open that date until the point at which it actually imposes the 
restitution, within the  days
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a -- this is, in one respect, Ms
 Karlan, a technical argument, is it 
not? Because it's true that this defendant, from the probation officer's report, knew within the  days what 
restitution was going to be recommended
 MS
 KARLAN: Yes
 He knew within the  days what the government's claim was going to be, but 
the court did not hold the hearing and did not impose 
the judgment
 And so the August th judgment became final by operation of law on October th, because that 
was  days after the July th sentencing
 At that point, the government could have filed an appeal in this case, and, quite frankly, they 
would have won
 As it was -- 
 JUSTICE ALITO: How is your position -- how is your position consistent with the thrust of the 
victims™ rights legislation that Congress has enacted in 
recent years, including the statute that™s before us 
here? Now, in this case, the victim -- the victim's medical bills were paid by the United States
 
But that isn't always going to be the case, and 
sometimes victims are going to have a lot of lost 
income
 So you have the victim, like the victim here, who is beaten to a pulp by a defendant and loses a 
substantial amount of future income as a result, and you 
say that if the judge makes a mistake, it's just too bad 
for the victim
 The victim gets nothing because the judge waited too long
 MS
 KARLAN: No, I don't --JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that™s what Congress had in mind? MS
 KARLAN: I don't say that, and I don't think that's what Congress had in mind
 First, what Congress had in mind was to strike the balance it struck 
in this statute, which was to give victims the right to 
receive restitution as part of a criminal sentence, as 
long as it was done within  days of sentencing
 Second, the government can appeal if a court 
 doesn't follow the rules
 Third --JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, but wasn't -- wasn't the whole thrust of the victims' rights legislation that 
up to that point, Congress thought prosecutors were not 
sufficiently attending to the rights and the interests 
of victims? They were doing their own prosecutorial thing, but they weren't involving victims, making sure 
they knew about court proceedings, and so forth
 And you™re saying, well, if the court makes a mistake and the prosecution falls down in its 
responsibility, the person who suffers is the victim who 
gets victimized again
 MS
 KARLAN: No, that's not what I'm saying
 What I'm saying is Congress struck a balance
 They wanted to give restitution to victims
 They also wanted final sentencing for defendants
 Congress struck that balance by giving a -day extension
 It didn't provide --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you™re not really -- you™re not really answering Justice Alito's 
question
 He says he understands that, as I understand the question
 We understand that argument
 But it doesn't address the fact that the net result of your argument is (a) unfair to the victim and (b) inconsistent with the whole design and thrust of the  
 Victims Act
 MS
 KARLAN: It™s --JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you, it seems to me, have to say: So be it; the technical rule prevails
 That's too bad
 I mean, that's your argument, it seems to me
 MS
 KARLAN: No, my argument is Congress struck that balance, and in some cases, yes, too bad --JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the same thing would happen if the trial judge makes a mistake of law 
which causes the -- the defendant to be acquitted, so 
that he not only escapes the liability to the victim, he 
escapes any -- any criminal punishment
 It happens all the time
 The judge makes a mistake; society pays for it
 MS
 KARLAN: That's correct, and Congress here has said  days
 And they meant it
 If they had meant to say, at any time, a victim can receive 
restitution, they would have said that
 JUSTICE BREYER: But Congress says -- to paraphrase and not get it accurate -- that the 
Department of Transportation shall enact a rule 
governing tire safety within  months from the 
effective date of this legislation
 And the Department  
 of Transportation fails to do that
 It doesn't promulgate its law for  months
 Is that law invalid? The rule? MS
 KARLAN: No, generally, under this --JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, it isn't
 MS
 KARLAN: Because that™s --JUSTICE BREYER: So how is this different? MS
 KARLAN: Well, this is a criminal sentencing statute which is different than a civil 
agency action
 JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that point
 I'm just asking what™s a relevant difference? MS
 KARLAN: That is the incredibly relevant difference, for the following reason --JUSTICE BREYER: Because? MS
 KARLAN: -- that finality in sentencing is important, because otherwise a defendant cannot even appeal his conviction
 JUSTICE BREYER: Why couldn't he? MS
 KARLAN: Because he --JUSTICE BREYER: You just read us the provision
 MS
 KARLAN: It's not a final --JUSTICE BREYER: The judge enters a -- an order, a final order
 And that final judgment, as was  
 true here, says: I haven't decided restitution yet
 He can appeal
 Then what it says is when you get around to the restitution, then enter another judgment, and you™ll 
appeal that, as happens precisely in the case of 
the  days -- you know, that extra stuff that Justice 
Scalia was referring to
 That's a possible interpretation of the Federal Rules of Appellate 
Procedure
 I don't see, you know, the appeals thing
 I don't see anything -- I don't have in front of me the 
language on filing an appeal, but I can't think of 
anything that™s contrary
 MS
 KARLAN: What™s contrary to that is that the Federal courts of appeals only have 
jurisdiction to decide cases that come up, in criminal 
cases, on final judgment or under the collateral order
 JUSTICE BREYER: That's right
 MS
 KARLAN: This is not --JUSTICE BREYER: It's a final judgment, and because there is another provision that says an order of 
restitution is itself a final judgment
 MS
 KARLAN: No
 With all respect, Justice Breyer, there is no provision that says an order 
of restitution --JUSTICE BREYER: You read it to us
 I mean the one you read to us
  
 MS
 KARLAN: No
 That says --JUSTICE BREYER: What? MS
 KARLAN: -- that a sentence that includes a term of restitution can be a final judgment, 
even though that -day provision to which 
Justice Scalia pointed is on the books
 But you can't have a final judgment in a criminal case that involves several different components 
of a sentence until those aspects of the sentence have 
actually been imposed
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why isn't the --MS
 KARLAN: Justice Scalia, I believe, was referring to the -day provision
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, the same problem
 MS
 KARLAN: The -day provision is specifically immunized from the final judgment rule by 
section (o) of the statute
 The -day provision is not
 So until a defendant -- perhaps I could -- perhaps I could use a slightly different example, which is: 
Suppose a defendant is supposed to be a sentenced to a 
fine, a mandatory fine --JUTICE BREYER: I see
 MS
 KARLAN: -- and a mandatory prison sentence
 If you sentence him to the mandatory prison sentence and 
say I still need to calculate the fine -- there is no 
 final judgment
 He cannot appeal that sentence
 JUSTICE ALITO: But isn't there a difference between those two situations? A fine is a criminal penalty
 It goes -- it -- the prosecution is brought in the same of the sovereign
 The fine goes to the sovereign
 It's a traditional criminal penalty
 Restitution is not a traditional criminal penalty
 It's much like, arguably, attorneys' fees in a civil case
 It is -- it is like -- it is really a -- a benefit for the victim
 It is not something that inures to the benefit of the sovereign
 And so why doesn't it make sense to view that judgment of restitution as a separate judgment, 
just as the award of an attorney™s fees is a separate 
final appealable order in a civil case? MS
 KARLAN: Well, because this judgment of restitution is not a civil judgment
 It is part of the defendant's criminal punishment, and, therefore, it is 
not like attorneys' fees, something that™s separate
 As we point out in our reply brief, in order to calculate the amount of imprisonment, in order to 
calculate the fine, the Federal criminal sentencing 
provisions -- and I should note that section (a) 
appears in Title  in the section under miscellaneous 
sentencing provisions, not civil provisions
 All of  
 those things interact
 And so you can't calculate one of those without knowing all of them
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, functionally, isn't it a substitute for the remedy that the victim of a 
crime might have? Wasn't what Congress was trying to do was to spare the victim the necessity of suing the 
defendant and having his kind of civil restitution 
tacked onto the criminal proceeding? MS
 KARLAN: That™s certainly Congress's purpose, but they did it within the context of 
sentencing
 So, for example, Justice Ginsburg, if this really were a civil penalty, defendants would not be 
entitled to the assistance of counsel in challenging the 
amount of restitution, because the Sixth Amendment would 
not apply
 The dates for filing an appeal would be different
 There would be a jurisdictional bar that doesn't exist in criminal cases
 This Court said several times that restitution under these kinds of circumstances -- in 
Hughey, under the predecessor to this Act, and in Kelly v
 Robinson -- is a penal statute
 Justice Sotomayor in her opinion for the Second Circuit in Varrone said this 
is a penal statute
 So there is no question here that this is a substitute for a civil remedy or a supplement for a  
 civil remedy, but it is a criminal punishment
 And Congress has said that you have to order it at 
sentencing or within  days, or else it is error that 
can be corrected through Rule  or by appeal, but not 
otherwise
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, what -- what can the defendant do within that  days? He has to wait  days before he appeals the sentence that he has been 
given; is that right? MS
 KARLAN: That's correct
 There is not a final judgment in his case
 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's  months that --that he has to sit on his hands
 MS
 KARLAN: That's correct
 JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that? MS
 KARLAN: Well, the final judgment rule says that
 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, this is a court-made rule of what counts as a final judgment
 MS
 KARLAN: Right
 And -- and --JUSTICE BREYER: All right
 Is there anything in the decisions of this Court interpreting 
that rule? I mean, you could have collateral orders
 You could have all kinds of things
 And doesn't it boil down to the same question?  
 I mean, I agree with you that if Congress wanted to make a -day deadline, you really have to do 
it, and you can't restitute thereafter
 All right
 That's one thing
 But if they didn't, why didn't they equally intend the judgment without the restitution 
order to be a final judgment? MS
 KARLAN: Well --JUSTICE BREYER: And then later on, just as in (o), if the judge does impose an order of restitution, 
then of course, that's appealable, and that's a different 
judgment
 Is there -- what in the law prevents the --that interpretation? MS
 KARLAN: I think two things prevent that interpretation
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes
 MS
 KARLAN: One is this Court's precedent, and let me talk about that
 And two is a proper reading of section (o)
 So I™ll turn first to the precedent and then to (o)
 JUSTICE BREYER: So you have precedent
 MS
 KARLAN: So the precedent is, for example, this Court said in Parr v
 United States, which 
is cited on page  of the reply brief, among other 
places, that ﬁa judgment or decision is final for purpose 
of appeal only when it terminates the litigation between the 
 parties on the merits of the case, and leaves nothing to be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined
ﬂ Until restitution has been determined, a case does not fit within Parr
 Parr is, I believe, an interpretation of ,  U
S
C
 , which is the provision that gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you can -- under your view, you can change the amount of jail time up to the point at which you have to set the restitution
 The judge says: I'm going to sentence you to  years, and I'm going to figure out the restitution
 He looks, and the restitution turns out to be a lot more than he thought
 So he says: Well, I'm only going to give you  years
 Or it's less, and he says: I'm going to give you  years
 Because the judgment is still open, he can do that? MS
 KARLAN: I believe, Your Honor, that he can
 And the reason for that is the sentencing statute itself --  U
S
C
 section , I believe it is --talks about how a court, in sentencing a defendant, is supposed to be considering all of these penalties and 
how they interact with one another
 So if a defendant can make restitution to a victim by, for example, being put on community release  
 or probation rather than serving time in prison, a court 
can take that into account in setting the sentence
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Must take it into account --MS
 KARLAN: Yes
 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if you read  the way it's written
 MS
 KARLAN: Yes, I think they must take it into account
 Now, whether -- how they™ll actually strike that balance is --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there no -- is there no possibility that a judge could say: I want to make this analogous to (b) under the civil rules; that is, 
I don't want to delay the time that the defendant can 
appeal from the -- from the -- from the sentence
 So this order is final, and  months later, I™ll take up 
the question of restitution when all the information is 
in
 The court is prevented from doing that? MS
 KARLAN: I™m unaware of any criminal rules analogue to Rule (b) in the civil context, because 
in general, as I understand the way this Court's 
precedents have worked, there have been what might look 
like interlocutory appeals in criminal cases, but they™ve 
always involved collateral issues
 And the problem here, for the reason that Justice Scalia just pointed to, is restitution and the  
 amount of imprisonment are not collateral to one another; that is, they may interact
 And a fine certainly isn't, because the statute itself says you 
can't impose a fine to the extent that it will impair 
restitution
 So if --JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the judge -- but the judge could say -- once she thinks she needs -- that they need time for more information: I'm going to defer the whole sentencing
 So, Defendant, you™ll have to wait  months to find out how much time you™re going to 
serve
 That would be all right
 You could use the -day period to extend the time for imposing the sentence
 Well, in effect, you™re saying the sentence isn't final, so she could change it any time within the  days? MS
 KARLAN: There's a slight complication there, but I think the answer to your question is yes; 
that is, the judge could delay the entire sentencing under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 
 Look, we™re not saying that you couldn't get restitution in a case like this
 We™re simply saying that you have to follow the rules
 JUSTICE BREYER: All right
 Well, what about that as a possible answer? If we accept -- the -- the judge,  
 of course, could say to the defendant: I'm not going to sentence you; I'm not going to put that sentence -- I'm 
not going to sentence you at all --MS
 KARLAN: That's correct
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- for  days
 MS
 KARLAN: That's correct
 JUSTICE BREYER: And your remedy, then, might be to ask for mandamus, if that was too long a 
period? MS
 KARLAN: It -- it might be
 I --JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and -- so why wouldn't that be similar here? If the judge is going to go after the  days, he™d have the power to do it, 
but it would be like a continuance, and he™d have to 
exercise that reasonably
 MS
 KARLAN: Because you have to follow the rules as laid down
 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no
 I know
 You™re interpreting it literally, and --MS
 KARLAN: Yes
 Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and that's --MS
 KARLAN: -- that is, there are many mechanisms for ensuring that a victim --JUSTICE BREYER: But I mean, if I thought, for argument's sake -- 
 MS
 KARLAN: You can™t --JUSTICE BREYER: -- that Congress doesn't care about whether it's after  days -- it was just to sort of speed things up -- on that assumption, wouldn't you still have a remedy, because it would be like the 
unreasonable continuance? MS
 KARLAN: That's correct
 JUSTICE BREYER: That is correct? I've got it? MS
 KARLAN: If -- if you -- you can't have a continuance from the  days
 You can have a continuance --JUSTICE BREYER: No, no
 I'm thinking of --MS
 KARLAN: -- of sentencing itself
 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm thinking of the general problems --MS
 KARLAN: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- of continuances for sentencing
 MS
 KARLAN: Yes, that's correct
 JUSTICE BREYER: And your argument is that  days is long enough? MS
 KARLAN: That's correct
 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay
 I™ve got it
 MS
 KARLAN: And I™d like to reserve the 
 remainder --JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you one question? JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I have a question going just to that
 It seems to me that if , as -- as I said -- maybe you shouldn't have agreed -- requires the 
sentencing court to consider the totality of the 
sentence it™s imposing, including the restitution, 
that would mean that the judge cannot impose a sentence 
before the expiration of the  days; that is, has to 
wait until the restitutionary issue is resolved to 
impose the incarceration part of the sentence
 No? MS
 KARLAN: I think the way that the statute is written contemplates that the judge will do 
the regular sentencing at which he imposes these other 
terms, but may keep it open for  days
 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question before you sit down? Are you aware -- maybe you cite them in the briefs and I didn't catch it -- of any cases 
in which the courts -- a court of appeals has 
dismissed an appeal because it was taken before the --
the civil remedy had been imposed? MS
 KARLAN: I'm not aware of a case that does that directly under the Mandatory Victims 
Restitution Act
  
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 Mr
 Heytens
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J
 HEYTENS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MR
 HEYTENS: Thank you, Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To begin by addressing the question just raised by Justice Stevens, the government agrees that we 
are not aware of any cases that directly confront this 
finality question
 There are, however, at least four cases in the courts of appeals where one of two things 
happened: Either the defendant took an appeal from the original term of his imprisonment, then later took an 
appeal from the order of restitution and the appeals 
were consolidated
 That happened, among other things, in the Cheal case, which is the First Circuit decision 
cited in our brief
 There are at least two other circuit court cases that do that as well
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was it within the  days? MR
 HEYTENS: No
 It --JUSTICE SCALIA: The restitution sentence was after the  days? MR
 HEYTENS: That's correct, Justice Scalia
 Now --JUSTICE STEVENS: In those -- in those -- in 
 that case, or any of those four cases, did they discuss 
the problem of whether there was -- both appeals were 
proper? MR
 HEYTENS: Justice Stevens, I™m not aware of any case that squarely --JUSTICE STEVENS: They just went ahead and consolidated? MR
 HEYTENS: That's correct, Justice Stevens
 I'm not aware of any case that directly confronts this issue
 Now --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under your view of things, however, that's fortuity that the underlying 
conviction was still in the appeal process, because 
there is no statute of limitations under your reading
 
A victim could come , , , , , , or  years 
later and say: I'm entitled to restitution
 MR
 HEYTENS: The statute --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And absent prejudice to the defendant, that would be okay? MR
 HEYTENS: Absent prejudice or some sort of double jeopardy problem, that's correct
 The statute, by its terms, says as long as the victim comes 
forward within  days of the discovery of his losses, 
(d)() expressly says that the victim can do that
 So I think this -- 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, that's  days after the restitution order has been issued
 Am I --MR
 HEYTENS: I believe that's incorrect, Your Honor
 The provision that we™re referring to, subsection (d)(), is reproduced on page A of the 
appendix to the government's brief
 It's the, I believe, second sentence of (d)() that we™re 
discussing right now that states: "If the victim subsequently discovers further losses, the victim shall 
have  days after the discovery of those losses in 
which to petition the court for an amended restitution 
order
" JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That  days says after there has been an -- a restitution order
 I'm positing the situation where the victim comes  years later
 MR
 HEYTENS: That's correct
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That says there™s no restitution order
 It's the initial action
 And you™re saying that's okay? It's an endless statute? MR
 HEYTENS: It is -- it is certainly not okay, Your Honor
 Congress has directed that this determination must be made and that it must be made 
within  days
 And Federal district courts are required to comply with that obligation
 
 But what Congress has not done is to specify a consequence that occurs in the situation where the --JUSTICE SCALIA: But it -- it -- it's sort of a ridiculous consequence that  years later, and 
the judge who tried the original case is dead
 I think it's bad enough to have the issue of whether this victim suffered $, damages 
decided by the judge, if that's what you™re going to be 
sentenced to, but at least it's being decided by the 
judge who tried the case
 And under your proposal, it can be decided by some other judge who is just -- just 
pulled in, because the -- the trial judge has -- has 
been deceased
 That doesn't seem to me to make any sense at all
 MR
 HEYTENS: Your Honor, I don't think it is our proposal
 Congress has not specified -- Congress has certainly required this to be done within  days
 
That meant Congress wanted it to be done within  days
 
But Congress has not specified a consequence for --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the consequence is the usual consequence when trial courts 
make errors, which is to appeal
 MR
 HEYTENS: Your Honor, I think this Court said in Montalvo-Murillo what the consequence is in this 
category of cases, which is when a trial court fails to 
 comply with a mandatory time limitation for doing 
something that the court is required to do, the remedy 
is -- unless Congress provides otherwise, such as it 
does in the Speedy Trial Act, the remedy is not a loss 
of the power on the part of the court to act
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't the statute establish time limits for filing an appeal? MR
 HEYTENS: The statute does, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it -- does it state a remedy for it? I don't think so
 But if you don't comply with the time limit, you're too late; you can't 
file the appeal
 MR
 HEYTENS: Justice Scalia --JUSTICE SCALIA: Same thing here
 MR
 HEYTENS: There™s a critical difference between a statute of limitations for filing a notice of 
appeal and what™s happening here that™s illustrated by 
the example given by Judge Gorsuch in his opinion for 
the courts of appeals
 There can be two kinds of time limits
 The first kind can say, if you want to do something -- you™re 
not required to do it -- but if you want to do it, 
you have to do it within a certain time
 That's what a statute of limitations is
 The second kind of time limit is to say you  
 must do something and you must do it within a second --
within a certain amount of time
 This case is the second category, just as the statute at issue in 
Montalvo-Murillo was in the second category of cases, and 
just as --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except that that was a bail question, where there's not issues of finality at 
play, and bail is a question that repeats itself 
throughout the proceedings
 Defendants are denied bail and then make a different showing of other 
resources or less danger or whatever, and they get out
 
And vice versa, defendants are out and are put in
 
That's it
 There are no finality questions there
 What do you do in this situation when you™re dealing with a criminal sentence where there are 
finality rules? And I'm going to tie that back to my starting point, which is I™m looking in your brief for the 
precedent and/or legal basis for us to treat restitution 
as not part of the final judgment in this criminal 
action
 What -- what other examples do we have in the criminal context? MR
 HEYTENS: We cited the things we cite in our brief
 There is, however, also a statute; I apologize to the Court, it is not cited in our brief,  
 but it is section  U
S
C
 section (b)
 That provision is captioned Imposition of a Sentence of 
Imprisonment
 Subsection (b) -- subsection (b) of that provision says Effect of Finality of the Judgment
 It then says, ﬁNotwithstanding the fact that a sentence of 
imprisonment can subsequently beﬂ modified or altered in 
certain ways, and then this is the critical language: "a 
judgment of conviction that includes such a sentence 
constitutes a final judgment for all other purposes
" In this case there was a judgment of conviction
 It was entered on July , 
 And that judgment of conviction imposed a sentence of 
imprisonment on Mr
 Dolan
 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, now suppose -- now we™re getting to exactly the point where I thought your 
co-counsel, your sister counsel had a good point that I 
wasn't -- hadn't thought through, and that is what 
happens now in -- on day -- we™re finished the 
trial
 The sentencing is over
 They got the presentence report, and the judge enters -- suppose he 
entered a judgment but didn't say anything about 
restitution, because he says: I™d like to give you a chance to appeal this
 And I'm not going to deal with restitution for a month when the victim recovers -- all 
within the  days
  
 Can the defendant appeal that piece of paper? MR
 HEYTENS: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: The answer is because of this provision? MR
 HEYTENS: We think because of that provision and because of general principles of law
 JUSTICE BREYER: Whoa, whoa
 What about what the -- what -- what you just heard quoted, 
forgetting this particular sentence in the code, was that 
a judgment isn't final -- you can only appeal a final 
judgment until all the parts that are there, and the 
restitution is part of it
 And so until it's final, you can't appeal it
 That's what -- that's what the case Parr, which it quoted
 What is -- what is your response to that? MR
 HEYTENS: That certainly establishes the general rule that this Court has said repeatedly --JUSTICE BREYER: Yes
 MR
 HEYTENS: -- that the jurisdiction of the Federal courts is established by Congress
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I just want to make clear where we are
 Justice Breyer said, can the defendant appeal? You said yes
 Suppose he said, must the defendant appeal? 
 MR
 HEYTENS: The defendant in our view is required to appeal --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Must? MR
 HEYTENS: Once the district court enters a judgment that imposes a sentence of imprisonment, if 
the defendant wishes to appeal that sentence of 
imprisonment he has  days to do so following the entry 
of the judgment, yes, which is the normal rule in 
Federal criminal cases
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if he misses --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even though -- even though he says the restitution shall be held in abeyance 
pending receipt of information? MR
 HEYTENS: Well, to the extent that he has an objection to the district court's -- it depends 
on the precise circumstances of the case, Justice 
Kennedy
 To the extent what he says is, I think the district court needs to, when it imposes the sentence of 
restitution, take into account the other aspects of the 
sentence, at that time the issues become interrelated
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me see if I understand this
 He has  days to appeal that
 And if he doesn't do that, then later within the  days or even after the 
 days, a sentence of restitution is imposed, he can --
he can appeal that sentence of restitution, right? 
 MR
 HEYTENS: Absolutely
 JUSTICE SCALIA: On the same grounds on which he would have appealed the -- the sentence of 
imprisonment, right? MR
 HEYTENS: Well, it -- to the extent --JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if it's an error in the trial, he claims: I was innocent
 MR
 HEYTENS: No, Justice Scalia
 JUSTICE SCALIA: No? MR
 HEYTENS: To the -- his time for appealing from the judgment of conviction runs from the 
entry of the judgment of conviction, which is 
contemporaneous with the imposition of the sentence of 
imprisonment
 If he wants to appeal that, he needs to do that like any other --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I suppose it's no -- no imprisonment; it's supervised release
 Now what happens? MR
 HEYTENS: If it™s -- if the judge imposes a sentence of supervised release, I am not aware if there 
is a specific statute
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but I mean, what's bothering me about this, and I'm not aware -- but you™re 
quoting a sentence that wasn't in your brief and what I 
hadn't taken in at all is the extent to which this is 
 inextricably mixed up with the rules of appeals, which are very important
 So unless I have in my own mind how -- how this all fits together, I -- I don't know how to decide this case
 I don't want to say something in here that™s going to muck up the -- the rules of appealing from a 
criminal case
 Now, what you™ve told me is I'm supposed to say that within  days of a -- of a judgment imposing imprisonment, 
he has to appeal, but of course if it's supervised release, he doesn't, or I'm not sure
 MR
 HEYTENS: Justice Breyer, first and foremost, the Court doesn't need to say anything about any of these issues
 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? MR
 HEYTENS: For one very simple reason: The only thing that this defendant has ever attempted to 
appeal at any point is the order of restitution
 He never attempted to appeal from his guilty plea
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but if -- but I have to be able to write my reasons, and in doing that I have 
to respond to the argument of the other side, which is that the strongest reason for thinking Congress intended this to be final and not beyond  days is that if you don't do that, you muck up the rules of appeal
 Now,  
 explain to me why that isn't so
 MR
 HEYTENS: A couple of reasons, Your Honor: First of all, I think it's actually one of the strongest arguments against their position, because it 
creates the unlikely scenario where it will be 
routinely -- we know that Congress has authorized these 
determinations to be made up to  days after the 
imposition of sentence
 So their rule would create the situation where it would be completely consistent with 
Congress's intent to routinely create a situation where 
a Federal criminal defendant has to wait  months after 
sentencing until he can appeal
 JUSTICE BREYER: Which is just what you say he has to do if the sentence is supervised release
 MR
 HEYTENS: What I'm saying, Justice Breyer, is I -- I -- I know there is a statute that 
governs imprisonment
 I believe there is a similar statute that governs a sentence of probation
 JUSTICE SCALIA: What was that statute on imprisonment? MR
 HEYTENS:  U
S
C
 (b), Justice Scalia
 I know there is a statute that governs that
 We also know there is a statute governing a term of 
restitution itself
 That's the provision cited, (o), which is reproduced at a of the appendix to our  
 brief --JUSTICE SCALIA: I've got it
 MR
 HEYTENS: -- which is the rules governing finality with regard to an order imposing 
restitution
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Heytens, one problem with the -- we have said that notice of appeal -- that 
that time limit is jurisdictional, which means if the 
defendant misses that deadline, no appeal
 And we™re leaving this in a nebulous state if the judge says, 
within -- this is -- this is a judgment of conviction 
and sentence, but I'm still thinking about the 
restitution
 The defendant has to know at that point, must I appeal that first judgment? Because if I don't, I'll never be able to appeal it
 But on your reading, the defendant can't wait
 When the judge imposes a sentence, the defendant must meet the time clock for notice of appeal from the 
sentence
 MR
 HEYTENS: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg
 In our view, the defendant -- when the judgment of conviction was imposed on this case, 
which imposed a sentence of imprisonment on Mr
 Dolan, 
the time for appealing the judgment of conviction and  
 the term of imprisonment began to run
 If I could go back to Justice Breyer's question --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- that would mean even if the judge says, I™m going to impose the 
restitution order  days from now, defendant's time 
clock for notice of appeal would begin at -- at the time 
the sentence is imposed, not  days later when 
restitution is --MR
 HEYTENS: That's correct
 He files a notice of appeal when the judgment of conviction 
is entered, and then  days later he can file a second 
notice of appeal, and courts of appeal can consolidate 
that case in the ordinary course
 You don't -- to answer Justice Breyer's very specific question about the supervised released, I have 
been advised that a district court cannot impose a term 
of supervised release unless it also imposes a sentence 
of imprisonment
 So that particular hypothetical that Justice Breyer raised wouldn't arise
 The court can't just --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, let's --let's suppose there™s no (d)(), and we™re back to 
just (a)(), which says when sentencing a defendant, 
the court shall order restitution
 What if the  
 judge doesn't -- is that mandatory? It has to be when sentencing the defendant? MR
 HEYTENS: I don't think so, Your Honor
 I think what --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think even without (d)(), the judge can say: I know it says when I'm sentencing I™ve got to order restitution
 
But  months later, he can do it? MR
 HEYTENS: Mr
 Chief Justice, let me amend my answer slightly
 He -- the judge is required to do it when sentencing --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but nothing happens if he doesn't
 Is that --MR
 HEYTENS: Well, the question then becomes one of a remedy
 The court is required to do it, and the question becomes what is the remedy when the 
court does not
 And what the Court said in Montalvo-Murillo is that we presume that Federal 
district courts will comply with the law, and that it is 
inappropriate in situations where Congress doesn't 
specify a remedy for courts to impose their own remedy
 
That was exactly the situation in Montalvo-Murillo
 JUSTICE BREYER: Why don't we go back to my hypothetical --MR
 HEYTENS: Sure
  
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and just substitute the word "fine" for "supervised release
" MR
 HEYTENS: Justice Breyer, I™m -- I™m fairly certain there is a statute that addresses the finality 
when it comes to a sentence that imposes a term of a 
fine, which is similar to the statute that addresses 
finality of a judgment of conviction that imposes only 
a term of imprisonment
 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not -- I'm not an expert in this area, as you can see
 And -- and I need to have a place to go to look so that I can see that 
these things, in your view, all work out, and you™re 
not creating some odd appellate system
 Do you have any suggestions for me as to what I could go and read and 
look at that would help me? MR
 HEYTENS: Justice Breyer, to address your very specific fine question, there is in fact a 
statute that addresses that as well
 That is  U
S
C
 (c)
 It's structured very similarly to the -- the section regarding judgments of imprisonment that I 
quoted to the Court earlier, and Congress has addressed 
that
 It says: "Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence to pay a fine can subsequently be altered in 
various respects, a judgment that includes such a 
sentence is a final judgment for all other" --
 JUSTICE BREYER: Can the (o) -- you remember -- you know what I'm referring to by (o)? MR
 HEYTENS: Yes, Justice Breyer
 JUSTICE BREYER: All right
 Can that be read to refer to initial -- an initial judgment of 
restitution as well as an amended judgment? MR
 HEYTENS: Absolutely, Justice Breyer
 That's exactly what the First Circuit said in the Cheal 
case, which is cited in our brief
 The First Circuit in that case addressed an initial judgment that said, 
similarly, somewhat, to the judgment in this one -- the 
original judgment, if you recall, in this case says the 
Mandatory Victims Restitution Act is applicable; 
however, the court does not have sufficient information 
to calculate restitution at this time
 What the First Circuit reasoned in Cheal is that that can be 
interpreted as a judgment imposing a restitution 
obligation, which is thus final under subsection (o)
 
If you conclude that, you don't need to look at any 
other statute to resolve --JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though there™s no amount given? MR
 HEYTENS: Yes, Justice Scalia
 Because the one thing we know for certain is that even if it had 
stated an amount, the fact that the amount can be amended 
 later doesn't deprive the judgment of finality
 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this --JUSTICE SCALIA: Simply because when you state an amount, that amount can be amended later, that 
leads to the conclusion that you need not even state an 
amount? Do you do the same thing for imprisonment? You say: I'm going to send you to prison; I'm not sure how many years, but I'm going to send you to prison
 Is that appealable right away? MR
 HEYTENS: Well, Justice Scalia, the district court is not permitted to do any of this
 
Congress has required the district court to set the 
amount --JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but district courts don't always do what they are supposed 
to
 And it seems to me a very strange result that you're --MR
 HEYTENS: It's true that, regrettably, district courts sometimes don't do what they are 
supposed to
 What this Court has said, most notably in Montalvo-Murillo, is that we should assume that they 
will, and that it™s inappropriate for courts to craft 
legal rules that are based on the presumption that they 
are going to violate their legal obligations
 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this  
 hypothetical? Supposing the defendant fails to appeal when he's sentenced, and then  days later, they impose 
a restitution order and he appeals from that
 May he raise the issues about guilt and innocence and error in 
the trial in that appeal? MR
 HEYTENS: Justice Stevens, just to make sure I understand -- I want to make sure I understand 
the hypothetical -- it's that the district court 
sentences him, enters a judgment of conviction, and then 
 days later imposes an order of restitution? JUSTICE STEVENS: Correct
 MR
 HEYTENS: Okay
 In that situation, no
 It is the government's view that he has -- the time for 
appealing the judgment of conviction and the sentence of 
imprisonment has run
 JUSTICE STEVENS: But he -- he can appeal just the restitution order
 MR
 HEYTENS: Just the restitution order, in that situation, yes
 Now, if he has appealed them both, they can be consolidated, which has been done in several 
cases in the courts --JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I understand that
 MR
 HEYTENS: -- in the circuit court of appeals
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You attach no significance  
 to the fact that in this case the judge said: I shall order restitution? It's the same as if he said nothing at all about restitution, so far as you are concerned? MR
 HEYTENS: We think this makes it an easier case, in terms of it establishes that there is no 
conceivable prejudice to Mr
 Dolan as a result of the 
delay in this case
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you this question: If we conclude there™s a hole in the statute that Congress has to amend, is it more likely that 
Congress will cure the statute if we rule for you or if 
we rule against you? It's pretty clear, the answer to that, isn't it? MR
 HEYTENS: Yes, Justice Stevens
 I think Montalvo-Murillo supplies the answer to that
 
Montalvo-Murillo says, where Congress does not supply a 
remedy for violation of a statutory time obligation, it 
is inappropriate for courts to invent their own in order 
to coerce district courts into complying --JUSTICE GINSBURG: So this then becomes a goal, not a time line -- a deadline? MR
 HEYTENS: I think -- at some point, it becomes a debate over precise wording, Justice Ginsburg
 
I think it is a deadline
 I think Congress intended for district courts to do this
 I think district courts who  
 have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws 
of the United States are required to do it
 The question is: What is the remedy in the rare, regrettable situation where they do not do it? And --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So a -- a defendant who is sentenced to a week in prison, and he decides, 
that's no big deal, I'm not going to appeal, and then 
finds out, you know,  days later he has got to pay a 
million dollars in restitution, is just out of luck, 
right? MR
 HEYTENS: Well, that would be -- yes
 That would be our view, Mr
 Chief Justice
 Now, what I would say is, it is, first of all, our view that the Court 
doesn't need to resolve any of this
 But, second of all, one of the reasons is there is another way the Court 
could resolve this, which is to follow the approach the 
Court took in its decision in Corey v
 United States, 
which is cited in the blue brief
 Now, Corey involved a statute
 It's presentence -- it's pre-Federal sentencing guidelines
 
It involves a statute that said if, at the time of the 
sentencing, the district court feels like it needs more 
information to decide how long to send the defendant to 
jail for, it may commit the defendant to the discretion 
of the Attorney General for a period of either  to  
  months; get, essentially, a PSR, before there were 
PSRs; and then make a determination then
 The Court in Corey faced the question: When the district court does that -- it says, I'm going to 
give you to the Attorney General, and we'll come back in 
 months and decide what your sentence will be -- when 
does the defendant have to appeal? That was the question before the Court in Corey
 What the Court said in Corey is that the defendant may appeal either at the time he is committed 
to the discretion of the Attorney General or at the time 
the district court imposes the final sentence
 The reason the Court said that -- this is the language 
that's cited in the blue brief -- is the Court said it 
would be extraordinary to tell a Federal criminal 
defendant that he might have to wait up to  months in 
order to take a notice of appeal from his judgment of 
conviction
 JUSTICE BREYER: Look, you straightened me out, from your point of view
 But now you've mixed me up again
 (Laughter
) MR
 HEYTENS: Sorry
 I didn™t realize, Justice Breyer
 JUSTICE BREYER: Because I think you said  
 that the defendant is just out of luck
 But, previously, you had said that (o) applies, so I thought what you 
were saying was that the sentence of imprisonment is 
immediately appealable and must be appealed within 
 days because of that 
 MR
 HEYTENS: That's our --JUSTICE BREYER: And then you said (o) applies, and (o) says that a sentence that imposes an 
order of restitution is a final judgment
 So if (o) applies, when,  months later or  months later, 
that restitution is made final and embodied in another 
judgment, that is a final judgment which can't be 
appealed
 So if you™re right about (o) applying, then the answer to the question is, no, he is not out of 
luck
 Now, don't just agree with me because I seem to be on your side in this question
 (Laughter
) MR
 HEYTENS: No --JUSTICE BREYER: I™ve got to figure this out
 MR
 HEYTENS: I apologize, Justice Breyer
 The government's position is that at the time the 
judgment of conviction and the sentence of imprisonment 
are entered, that is the time at which the defendant has  
 to appeal and, in our view, he may appeal
 Later, when the sentence of restitution is imposed, that is when 
he appeals that
 What I was suggesting is that, to the extent the Court has any concern about that, the alternative 
way of resolving this issue would be the same way the 
Court approached the issue in Corey, and you could say 
that the defendant could appeal at either time
 Now, we think that would be incorrect, but it would be open to the Court to do so to -- or to leave 
the issue open in order to resolve this case
 Because as I said before, this defendant never attempted to 
appeal his judgment of conviction or his original term 
of imprisonment
 So it's not, in this case, necessary to decide what exactly would have happened had he 
attempted to do so
 JUSTICE SCALIA: This criminal judgment of restitution -- I assume it's the judge who finds that the 
victim suffered so much money? MR
 HEYTENS: That's correct, Justice Scalia
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does he find that beyond a reasonable doubt? MR
 HEYTENS: No, Justice Scalia
 The burden -- 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just more likely than not? MR
 HEYTENS: That's correct
 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it's a criminal --it's a criminal judgment? MR
 HEYTENS: That's what Congress has provided
 And in this Court's decision in Oregon v
 Ice, the Court, admittedly in dictum, stated that 
restitution determinations are a category of 
determinations that have been historically made by the 
court, not by the jury
 And regardless of what anyone thinks is the answer to that question, it is certainly 
not within the question presented
 It has not been raised at any point by the Petitioner in this case
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose that an answer to the Chief Justice's concern about the -week sentence and 
-- and he's not concerned -- is that all criminal 
defendants know that an adjudication of guilt is 
preclusive of later issues with -- with respect to civil 
-- civil liability, and they take their chances
 But that -- that points up a difference between this case and Montalvo-Murillo
 In this case, finality is central to the system, and that wasn't --
that's not really -- wasn't really true in Montalvo
 MR
 HEYTENS: That's certainly correct, Justice Kennedy
 That was by its terms a bail 
 determination, which by its nature is not a final 
determination in the sense that a criminal statute is, 
though the Court's language doesn't really suggest that 
that would make any difference
 And I would say that some of the other cases in this same line of cases, 
including some of the ones Justice Breyer mentioned, did 
raise finality concerns
 There was a very strong finality concern raised in the Peabody Coal case
 There were finality concerns raised in Brock, that Congress 
had said this needs to be done, and once it™s done, it 
needs to be done
 And so, there are -- some of the cases in this same line have also involved finality, 
admittedly not in the criminal context
 But I think the -- the most important thing that the Court said in -- the two most important things 
that the Court said in Montalvo-Murillo, as are relevant 
here, is that, first, when Congress doesn't specify a 
remedy -- and Congress has not specified a remedy in 
this case -- it™s inappropriate for courts to impose 
their own
 The second thing that the Court said is that we should presume that Federal district courts are going 
to comply with legal obligations, and we shouldn't make 
rules based on the assumption that they won't
 And third is that when courts do impose  
 remedies, they shouldn't make -- impose a remedy where 
there™s a profound lack of fit between the violation that 
occurred and the remedy that the defendant is asking 
them to impose
 Let me give you an example on that
 The general rule in Federal criminal litigation is that the 
Federal district court is supposed to impose sentence 
without unnecessary delay
 Now, say the district court violates that obligation
 It takes too long to impose a sentence
 I think it would be extraordinary to suggest that the remedy of a district court's unnecessary delay 
in sentencing the defendant means the defendant should 
get off scot-free
 The remedy is to tell the district court you have taken too long to impose the sentence; impose the 
sentence forthwith
 The same thing is true here
 Congress has told the district court you need to impose restitution 
in every case where the defendant is convicted of a 
crime of violence
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your argument is ﬁnot to exceed  daysﬂ means the same thing as ﬁwithout 
undue delayﬂ? MR
 HEYTENS: We don't think it means the same thing, Mr
 Chief Justice
 What we think it means  
 is the violation should have the same consequences
 The violation is to say if you don't do what you are 
supposed to, the remedy is to do it immediately
 The remedy isn't to say you don't have to do it anymore
 If there are no further questions, the government urges that the judgment of the court below be 
affirmed
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 Ms
 Karlan, you have  minutes
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S
 KARLAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MS
 KARLAN: I have three points -- excuse me -- to make: The first goes to what the remedy is here and what the error is here
 The error here occurred when the district court did not impose 
restitution
 The government should have filed a timely appeal under Rule 
 They had  days to do so
 The government did not appeal the failure to make 
restitution
 That error is not before this Court now
 What™s before this Court is a second judgment
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They couldn't do that until the end of the  days
 If the judge has  days to order restitution, that's a vicious cycle argument
 MS
 KARLAN: No, Justice Sotomayor, because  
 had the -- had the government on October  looked and 
said, there™s no restitution order in this case, they 
could have filed an appeal then under Rule , and they 
would have won
 They didn't do so
 Second --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that™s rather theoretical because if that -- I mean, the -- the judge 
surely would have acted before he could process an 
appeal
 MS
 KARLAN: Well, he lacks actually the --the power to do that
 Once the appeal is taken, he can't do that
 And may I just say that here I think the critical rule to understand is one sentence, one appeal
 
So turning first --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's not true
 I don't know if you™ve had time to look at  or  --MS
 KARLAN: Yes, I have
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Those do appear to say that once there™s a term of imprisonment, that that 
constitutes a final judgment
 MS
 KARLAN: But they do so in the context of Section (a), which is cited on page  of the 
yellow brief, which says ﬁthe court shall impose a 
sentence
ﬂ Now, the different components can each be  
 added together
 But there is one sentence in a criminal case on a particular charge, and that sentence can include restitution, it can include a fine, it can include imprisonment
 That doesn't make it three sentences
 And only when all of those have been imposed is there a final judgment
 Until then, the judgment --JUSTICE ALITO: It can also include forfeiture
 What™s -- what is the rule for forfeiture? MS
 KARLAN: I don't know the rule for forfeiture
 I do know the rule for all of the other criminal proceedings, which is (b), to which the government 
refers; (c) for fines; (b) for community 
release; and (o) for restitution
 All of those have to make one sentence, and then there is one appeal
 Under our rule, which I think comports with the plain language of the statute, we know when an appeal takes place, and there will be one appeal
 Under the government's rule --JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference -- in response to the last argument that your opponent made, 
what is the difference between the provision here and Rule (b)() of the criminal rules, the court must 
impose sentence without unnecessary delay? MS
 KARLAN: There, the question is, did it do it without unnecessary delay? Here the question is,  
 did it do it within  days? When it didn't, the government had to appeal
 The government did not do that
 JUSTICE ALITO: So if the -- I didn't understand the answer
 If the sentence is not imposed without unnecessary delay, the consequence is that there 
can be no sentence? MS
 KARLAN: No
 This Court has never decided what the rule means there
 But this is a statute
 And if I could turn to the question of what the statute --JUSTICE SCALIA: Before you do that, tell me what the government appeal would consist of
 The  days has expired --MS
 KARLAN: And the judgment of August th became final
 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you -- you tell me the court -- the court has no ability to impose 
restitution after  days
 MS
 KARLAN: That™s right
 The --JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the use of appealing? MS
 KARLAN: Because on appeal you say the court erred, and it imposed an illegal sentence --JUSTICE SCALIA: And the appellate court says too bad -- 
 "prevailing party," a term of art that has been used for 
hundreds of years, is not within section (g)(), but 
it is in other sections of ERISA
 Its statutory sibling, section (g)(), contains a judgment requirement
 Another provision of ERISA, (e), uses the terms "prevailing party
" JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could somebody have some success on the merits if they don't achieve a 
judgment of some sort? MR
 ATES: This case -- in the -- in the Bradley case, which was cited in Hanrahan, said you 
have many final orders in a case, and if the court 
determines an issue of -- a particular issue in a 
case -- and here it's finding an ERISA violation --
and as relief for that they are issuing an order 
requiring Reliance to act within  days, 
let's say the case settles at that point
 
That's enough for fees to issue should the parties not 
be able to agree on fees as a part of the settlement
 
It's the judicial act in finding the violation that 
triggers -- triggers the success on the merits
 And this case was on the merits
 As we pointed out in our very yellow brief, the district 
court --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But under your theory,  
 presumably no relief has to be granted? MR
 ATES: Relief does not have to be granted
 The district court --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But then what -- what's the difference -- is it your theory that if the district 
court -- for whatever reason, if this wasn't an ERISA 
case where a remand -- or where the court said they did 
violate, but I™ve now looked at the evidence that you™re 
proffering, the new evidence they did not consider, 
and it's not enough for benefits; you don't get it
 Is your argument that you are entitled to fees because they 
decided there was -- the court decided there was a 
violation of ERISA? MR
 ATES: Yes, it is
 My argument is you™re eligible for fees, and the amount of fees will be 
taken into account in determining the degree in the 
district court, taking these five factors into account, 
taking into effect your position on the merits, the 
defendant's position on the merits, and determining what 
that fee award should be
 But it should not operate as a barrier to getting into an eligibility question
 So she's eligible for fees in that instance, but what those fees should be is at the district court's 
discretion
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Going back to  
 Justice Scalia's question, what's the difference between 
Hanrahan, where there™s a violation of the civil 
procedure code which is an entitlement to process? Why aren't you successful, if this is a non-ERISA situation, 
merely for a finding that the district court acted 
improperly? MR
 ATES: Because you have to look at the party who is violating
 Here it™s the party who™s violating the law
 It's a party to the suit who is violating the law
 That violation is found in Hanrahan
 It's a civil procedure
 The district court didn't --didn't do something right
 Here -- and that's not a violation of the --of law
 That's a -- that's a misapplication of a civil -- of a rule of civil procedure
 Here we have a violation of law by a party
 That's the fundamental difference between us and Hanrahan
 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- ask this question? The question here is whether there was eligibility for fees
 Could the district judge in your view say, yes, I think the plaintiff is eligible for 
fees, but it was actually a very difficult legal issue, 
and the defendant's position was entirely reasonable, so 
I think as a matter of discretion I will not award any 
fees?  
 MR
 ATES: The district court can exercise its discretion and not award fees
 I think, however, that the better result is when a violation of law is 
proven, the plaintiff or in this instance a claimant or 
beneficiary should be entitled to some amount of fees 
because the purpose of the statute, explicitly stated in 
the statute, is to protect beneficiaries and claimants 
and have access to the Federal courts
 If every case is a close case and you™re not giving -- giving fees, then -- these are folks with 
limited means
 These are folks by definition cannot work when they are disabled, and you are eating up their 
benefit through attorney's fees
 And that cannot be the point of the statute when Congress enacted this
 It is to protect beneficiaries, to give appropriate -- give 
appropriate relief and keep open access to the Federal 
courts
 If I can get back to, again, why this is not a prevailing party statute, the language and structure 
clearly show that
 The history and context show it as well
 And I'm not talking legislative history
 I'm talking about the fact that ERISA supplanted the Welfare 
and Pension Plans Disclosure Act, which required a 
judgment before fees could issue, but Congress chose to 
remove that requirement when it originally enacted 
 ERISA
 It does not have that judgment language and does not have prevailing party language
 Moreover, this Court repeatedly has held that trust law should inform the interpretation of 
ERISA
 Trust law, for hundreds of years, has taken into account these principles that the district courts and 
courts of appeals have relied on for at least  years 
under ERISA to inform, guide, and limit district courts™ 
discretion in awarding fees
 I™d like to reserve the remainder of my time
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 Mr
 Shah
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A
 SHAH, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER MR
 SHAH: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The district court found that Respondent's original decision denying benefits disregarded pertinent 
medical evidence in violation of ERISA and found that 
the decision was otherwise unsupported by substantial 
evidence
 Based on those findings, the district court ordered Respondent to make a new benefits determination, 
after which Respondent finally granted the benefits due
 Those facts established Petitioner's  
 eligibility for a fee award under ERISA section 
(g)(), which authorizes a court to award reasonable 
attorney's fees, quote, "in its discretion," end quote
 
That discretion, as per ERISA more generally, is to be 
exercised in accordance with well-established trust law 
principles, and those principles quite clearly reject a 
strict prevailing party standard
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me whether you differ in your definition of "some success 
on the merits" than your predecessor colleague? Do you define it as in the manner he did, that it's any legal 
judgment in the Petitioner's favor that another party 
has done a wrongful act? I think -- I think I™m summarizing his position accurately
 MR
 SHAH: Yes, I -- I think we are in an agreement, Your Honor, with -- with -- with Petitioner's 
characterization
 When there™s a judicial order finding a violation --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, that's different than what he said
 MR
 SHAH: Okay
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right
 Yes, here there was an order of remand
 That's clear
 And I can understand the difference between an order, because 
there are many decisions of the court that end up in  
 orders that are not final judgments
 But there are decisions, like this one, I think according to him, that 
if the district court had said there was a violation of 
ERISA and the parties then settled without a judicial 
order reflecting that finding and/or requiring a remand, 
I think according to him he would say this party was 
entitled to fees
 MR
 SHAH: I don't want to characterize his view, but here's our view on -- on "some success on the 
merits
" If the order -- to be concrete about it, the order in this case -- assuming this case, all that --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I didn't assume this case
 MR
 SHAH: Pardon? JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No order, just a finding
 MR
 SHAH: So there™s a finding of an ERISA violation, period? JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And then a settlement
 MR
 SHAH: And then a settlement
 Well, Your Honor, I think it depends on which framework we™re 
operating under
 I think if we™re operating under well-established trust law principles, that clearly 
qualifies as enough success to justify a fee award
 And we can look at several of the trust cases cited in both  
 our brief and Petitioner's brief
 In re Catell's Estate is discussed in all the briefs
 There the plaintiff brought a claim to remove a trustee, and the basis for 
the claim to remove the trustee was a contention that 
the trustee wasn't complying with one of the terms of 
the trust
 After he filed the suit -- and this was before even any finding by the judge -- the trustee then 
complied with that particular term of the trust
 And then what the court said was, well, because the trustee 
complied with the underlying premise or the motivation 
for your suit, I'm going to deny your claim to have the 
trustee --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that seems like a catalyst theory, and that was, at least in dicta, 
rejected in -- in Ruckelshaus
 So how do you deal with that? MR
 SHAH: Well, it wasn't -- in the dictum in Ruckelshaus; it was actually accepted, Your Honor, in 
that -- in the footnote the Court -- in the dictum within 
Ruckelshaus, the Court says quite plainly that Congress, 
in departing from a strict prevailing party language 
in Ruckelshaus, meant to embrace judicial -- relief that 
wasn't encapsulated within a judicial order
 But we™re far afield from Ruckelshaus here,  
 because we actually have a judicial order, and we™re 
far afield from the outer limits of the trust --
trust law cases which -- which, for example, In re 
Catell's Estate, which I just mentioned -- and by no 
means is In re Catell's Estate an outlier
 The Third Circuit's opinion in Dardovitch, which is also cited in 
our brief, recounts In re Catell's Estate as falling 
well within the history of trust law cases
 Petitioner's reply brief at page  cites Grien v
 Cavano
 That's another case where a plaintiff brought -- brought a claim that a union fund was not 
complying with accounting and proper bookkeeping 
procedures
 After he filed the suit, they fell in line, adopted the various procedures that plaintiff had 
sought, and the court still said: Drawing upon trust law principles, we™re going to award fees
 Now, again, I don't think the court has --JUSTICE SCALIA: As the Respondent points out, the position you™re taking is unusual for the 
government
 The government is usually arguing against fees, because the fees are often assessed against the 
government
 MR
 SHAH: Right
 JUSTICE SCALIA: So long as you know that you™re making your bed and you™re going to have to lie  
 in it --(Laughter
) JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and you™re essentially saying that when there is simply a procedural victory, 
which happens all the time, when -- when an agency is --
is reversed in its procedure even though the -- the --
the petitioner here doesn't get any concrete relief 
until it goes back to the agency and may lose in the 
agency ultimately, you™re -- you™re content to say 
that fees are assessable in that situation, just by 
reason of the procedural victory
 MR
 SHAH: Your Honor, a couple of responses: First of all, ERISA is somewhat unique in that ERISA -- first of all, this provision doesn't have 
prevailing party language as -- unlike EAJA, for example
 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm talking about other prevailing -- I'm talking about other statutes that 
don't say "prevailing party
" MR
 SHAH: Okay
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure
 MR
 SHAH: I think still this provision is unique in that it™s informed explicitly by trust 
law principles, as this Court has held numerous --
in numerous decisions regarding other ERISA provisions
 
And the trust law principles depart from the American  
 rule
 All of those other statutes which you have in mind, Justice Scalia, are premised on the background of 
the American rule
 The trust law departs from American rule, and so when you interpret ERISA section (g)() 
based upon the trust law principles, I think that 
supports a different --JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm -- I'm -- I'm not sure it's reasonable to interpret an attorney's fee provision 
as having anything to do with trust law
 MR
 SHAH: Well, even --JUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's a requirement of attorney's fees enacted by -- by the Federal 
Congress, and I -- I find that very artificial
 MR
 SHAH: Well, Your Honor, it's -- it's a fee provision enacted within ERISA which explicitly 
states as one of its purposes to protect beneficiaries 
and to provide them access to courts
 This is in the legislative history
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I can see now why the red brief has a very substantial appendix with 
statutes
 Now, you say, oh, this is unique
 Well, then we may have many, many different kinds of statutes
 This does not provide for -- this is not a prevailing party 
statute
 MR
 SHAH: Correct
  
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But just in going through the list of the statutes, there are many statutes that 
are not prevailing party statutes
 And it seems to me that -- you say it's unique
 Well, it's unique in the sense it's in ERISA, but I -- I think it's very close to 
many -- many of the statutes with the language there in 
the red brief's appendix
 MR
 SHAH: Right
 And, Your Honor, previously the government has made narrow arguments
 
For example, there were arguments --JUSTICE BREYER: Take the case, though --just take the -- what is the government's position? The ERISA plaintiff wants $ million
 They get denied everything
 The -- the court says: I noticed here there was a -day deadline that you had, and he only 
gave you  days, so I'm sending it back, but I'll tell 
you your claim that there was enough evidence is absurd; 
you™re never going to win it
 And then he goes back, and he loses it
 Okay? He has had a procedural victory
 Does he get attorney's fees? Not -- not a chance that he™s going to win this claim, and, indeed, he 
loses it
 He doesn't get a penny
 Does he get attorney's fees, because on a technicality he won a new 
hearing? 
 MR
 SHAH: Under your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, a district court would be within its 
jurisdiction to deny attorney's fees
 That doesn't --JUSTICE BREYER: My question is --MR
 SHAH: He wouldn™t --JUSTICE BREYER: -- does the statute, in the view of the government, permit attorney's fees in the 
case I just mentioned? MR
 SHAH: Probably not in application
 He would be eligible, but a district court --JUSTICE BREYER: Your answer is, yes --MR
 SHAH: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- it does permit? MR
 SHAH: Yes
 But a district court applying --JUSTICE BREYER: All right
 You™re just saying it won't be a problem because the district court 
judges are all reasonable, and I know they think that
 (Laughter
) CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- what if the success is preliminary? You know, the plaintiff survives a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff survives a 
motion for summary judgment, wins every procedural 
issue, wins a privilege issue, gets discovery issues 
resolved, and at the end of the day loses? The plaintiff 
 has had --MR
 SHAH: No, Your Honor --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why? He has had some success
 MR
 SHAH: No, Your Honor, because that would be captured within Hanrahan, we think, and 
that's -- and that's easily distinguishable because 
those are errors -- even if some of those procedural 
victories were overturned on appeal or procedural losses 
were overturned on appeal, those are all errors within 
the court system or victories within the procedures of 
the court system, not a violation of -- on the merits of 
the underlying claim, which is what we have here
 We have a finding of a violation of ERISA and then relief ordered to --JUSTICE STEVENS: But then, aren't you treating the statute as though it did have a prevailing 
party clause in it? MR
 SHAH: Pardon, Your Honor
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is not your construction one that just treats the statute as though it required 
the plaintiff to be a prevailing party? MR
 SHAH: Well -- well, Your Honor, no
 I think our -- our -- our argument is to interpret it in 
light of trust law principles
  
 Now, the trust law cases -- there is language in some of the trust laws cases that suggests 
that fees -- fees could be awarded to unsuccessful 
litigants or regardless of outcome
 But I think if you read those cases, on the facts of those cases they don't 
go that far
 But I think what they do embody is a much broader notion of success than the strict prevailing 
party jurisprudence that this Court has promulgated --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under your -- under your rule would it be error for the district court to 
terminate its jurisdiction? It must keep jurisdiction to see how the play comes out in the end? MR
 SHAH: No -- no, Your Honor, I don't think it must keep jurisdiction
 But certainly in a case where it does retain --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it certainly has to in order to adopt the ameliorating factors that 
you -- that you use in order to justify this rule
 And I -- I -- it's not clear to me that courts usually 
retain jurisdiction in these cases
 MR
 SHAH: May I respond, Your Honor? A couple of responses, Justice Kennedy: First, if they didn't retain jurisdiction -- and in the Seventh 
Circuit, for example, that's one circuit which says that 
these orders have to be final, and final judgment has to 
 be entered -- then we™re exactly analogous to a 
sentence  Social Security case
 And this Court has made it clear in a line of decisions that upon entry of final judgment -- and 
those are exactly analogous in the sense that what 
happens is that the court finds that the decision below 
committed some error in law, it vacates that decision, 
and then sends it back to the Social Security 
Administration for a new determination without 
preordaining the result
 Regardless of the result there, at the time of the remand and entry of judgment, 
that plaintiff is eligible for -- for fees
 We think that the same outcome would be controlled here, even if the Court applied its strict 
prevailing party jurisprudence
 Thank you
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 Mr
 Rosenkranz
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICHOLAS Q
 ROSENKRANZ ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: No judge has ever decided the merits of Petitioner's claim for benefits
 Under this Court's holding in Ruckelshaus, the Petitioner must demonstrate  
 some success on the merits, and under Rule  she must 
specify the judgment entitling her to an award
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the footnote that was mentioned in Ruckelshaus that said: "Congress found it necessary to explicitly state that the term 
'appropriate' extended to suits that forced defendants 
to abandon illegal conduct" -- illegal conduct was found 
here -- "although without a formal court order"? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor
 Footnote  of Ruckelshaus addressed one sentence of legislative 
history of a different statute, and only so far as the 
Court pointed out that the sentence was of no use to 
Sierra Club in that case
 I don't think the footnote is properly read to be a full-fledged endorsement of the 
catalyst theory
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is not merely a catalyst
 In Buckhannon, the catalyst theory was rejected
 Here the court said: If I were to decide right now -- the district court said: I am inclined to rule for Hardt, but I'm going to give Reliance an 
opportunity to respond
 So the court had evaluated the evidence at that point as favoring Hardt
 To that extent, it wasn't a purely procedural ruling
 It says: As things stand now, Hardt should get fees; but I'm leaving the door  
 open
 So it wasn't just a procedural decision
 It was an evaluation of the evidence up to that point, wasn't 
it? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, but it would be an utterly unadministrable rule to attempt to 
weigh the inclinations of district judges in their opinions
 
This Court's precedents have made clear that we weigh 
success on the merits by evaluating judicial judgments
 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the judgment is, send it back
 That's what it says: Send it back
 And the reason for sending it back is this woman was undergoing 
terrible pain, that the Social Security Administration 
says she™s completely disabled, that she™s entitled in 
the -- on the evidence shown
 There™s no substantial evidence to the contrary
 But you, the company, want to take money from her instead of giving her the money
 Now, I™ve read the record
 It doesn't support anything contrary to what I™ve said
 So now you send it back
 Now, what is that but a big victory for the other side? Which then leaves the company to say: They're right; pay them
 Now, if that isn't -- I mean, what words of English -- if you™re -- we™re talking about partial success
 
Partial success, or not total defeat
 That is the language from Ruckelshaus
 Not "total success
" You  
 still get it
 Okay
 What in the English language can we read in a case or a statute that would say you 
shouldn't reach that commonsense result? Now, of course, I™m characterizing it a little bit, but it does 
seem like a commonsense result
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, Petitioner in this case, like all plaintiffs, arrived in court 
requesting a judgment, a judgment awarding her benefits
 
Indeed, she believed she was entitled to such a judgment 
as a matter of law, and she moved for judgment as a 
matter of law for summary judgment
 What the district court actually did was deny that motion for summary judgment
 Rather than give her the judgment she sought, the district court employed 
a particular procedural maneuver, which was to remand 
the case -- quote, "remand the case" -- to her 
litigation adversary to reconsider the question
 Now --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: His point -- your adversary's point -- is the court couldn't effect that 
procedural move without taking step one in what was 
requested
 It had to find some sort of violation, either to remand or to grant benefits, so that the 
relief sought, by definition, needed a finding by the 
court
 And your adversary says the court found an ERISA violation
  
 Now, the type of relief it grants is up to its discretion
 This is an equitable situation, and it exercised its discretion by doing a remand
 Why is that view different than calling it a procedural step? Isn't that a substantive win? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, this is a purely interlocutory order
 So this was not an end to the case
 This was not a decision on the merits
 This was a purely interlocutory order, on the road to a 
decision on the merits, perhaps, but the district court 
denied her motion for summary judgment, did not conclude 
that she was entitled to benefits as a matter of law and, 
instead, remanded the case for further proceedings
 So --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what is the impact on your position of our decision last week in 
Conkright v
 Frommert? I know you haven't had a chance to brief it, but I'm also sure had you a chance to read it
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, Conkright emphasizes that these judgments are to be made in the 
first instance and, in fact, in the second instance by 
claims administrators, that that is --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought that it -- one thing it did emphasize, that in the 
typical case, the likely relief is going to be sending 
it back rather than making a judicial decision, which --
 which seems to me, then, that -- and then presumably, in 
most cases, the person would prevail before the plan 
administrator
 So given Conkright, your position is going to severely limit the circumstances under which 
claimants are entitled to fees
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it's -- you are correct that in Conkright, the Court -- Court indicated 
that in most cases the district court should remand 
under circumstances like this
 You are quite correct
 Under circumstances like this, then, there would be 
fewer opportunities for district courts to award --
to award fees
 And that™s a correct result under (g)(), which, as informed by --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though the --as in Conkright, the claimant's success can -- before 
an agreement, can be quite dramatic
 This was a very, very significant victory for the claimant to get it sent 
back under those circumstances
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I'm not sure this should be characterized as a victory
 This is not a procedural maneuver that the plaintiff sought
 The plaintiff asked for summary judgment, and her summary 
judgment motion was denied
 And, instead, the district court chose to remand the case to her litigation  
 adversary
 Surely, at that moment at least, that surely could not have felt like a victory
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Future claimants will not ask for summary judgment from the district court, 
presumably, in light of Conkright
 They will ask that the case be remanded
 So, in future cases, will they have obtained a victory? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: I don't think that future claimants will ask for a remand as their final form of 
relief, Your Honor
 This was -- the relief that one asks for in one's complaint is the final judicial relief that 
one wants
 This is --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we've -- we've already told them they can't get that
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, a plaintiff could get an -- could get the relief of benefits if a 
claims administrator had acted severely improperly or in 
very bad faith
 A district court still has power to issue an award on summary judgment
 JUSTICE SCALIA: The claimant doesn™t --doesn't really claim that
 The claimant just says this was a wrong decision and they should do it correctly
 
And the claimant knows that all he's going to get from 
the district court is a remand
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: But the correct way to -- 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: So he would not ask for money and, therefore, would be victorious, on your 
analysis
 If all he asked for was a remand, he got a remand
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor
 A properly framed complaint under ERISA should still be a claim for 
benefits
 The -- the remand that Conkright contemplates is still an interlocutory remand, like the remand here
 
One does not put in one's complaint a desire for 
interlocutory relief, any more than one asks --JUSTICE BREYER: If someone wants a remand, it's a remand, but on limited grounds; that is, a 
holding of the district court
 The ERISA administrator was -- it's an abuse of his discretion to refuse to give 
this woman nothing
 In my opinion, she's entitled at least to $,, but whether it's  or , I don't 
know
 So I remand it to the ERISA administrator so he can decide to act within -- within his discretion, give 
her either , , , , , or 
 Now, in your view, attorney's fees -- all the statute says is the court, in its discretion, may 
allow a reasonable attorney's fee
 Nothing more
 Now, what would stop an attorney's fee in that situation? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor --JUSTICE BREYER: If that's what you think
 
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, a remand order under those circumstances might constitute success on 
the merits because it resolves an issue in the case, which 
was liability in the case
 So that perhaps would constitute success on the merits
 This resolved no substantive issue on the case
 This remand order simply says: As a procedural matter, go back and look at it again
 JUSTICE BREYER: You distinguish between him saying you have to give her at least  and his 
saying the evidence that supports giving her less than 
 is -- insufficient, is substantially -- is -- what's 
the word? Yes, worthless
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, this Court has -- this Court has expressly distinguished between 
judicial --JUSTICE BREYER: That's the line you draw? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, the difference between judicial pronouncements and judicial 
relief is one that this Court has --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- that's difficult
 Let's assume that a claims administrator or a plan administrator is not deciding the claim
 The party comes to court and says: Under ERISA, I have a right to a decision within X number of days; force them, mandamus 
them to give me a decision
 The court says: Reasonable; 
 you have a right to one
 And orders them to
 Under your theory, they™ve won nothing? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, in your hypothetical the -- the remand order would presumably be 
a final judgment, and it might well constitute success 
on the merits
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're -- you're --wait a minute
 Then we go back to a question that was asked by one of my colleagues
 If a plan participant came in and said they didn't consider evidence they 
should have; they didn't seek my treating physician's 
documents, and here they are; they should consider them 
now, and the court says you're right, enters a 
remand order, and dismisses the case -- that's enough? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I'm not sure that™s a properly formatted ERISA complaint
 If the gravamen of the complaint is "I want my benefits" then --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, what -- what™s the difference between the first example I gave, a 
mandamus to issue a decision -- that's not a claim for 
benefits, either; it's a claim for a decision
 What's the difference between that and the second hypothetical? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: If the -- if the gravamen of the complaint is a complaint for benefits, then the 
complaint should ask for benefits, and the judge should  
 resolve that case
 A remand would always maintain jurisdiction -- should always maintain jurisdiction over 
the case, thus always be interlocutory and procedural
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that how it works? Remands always retain jurisdiction? I would --I would have thought the district judge would want the 
thing off his or her docket, you know, for the 
statistics, if anything
 And --(Laughter
) CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and would say, and maybe could say -- well, what if the judge says: 
Look, I don't know if you™re going to prevail or not 
on remand
 My decision actually doesn't help you much one way or the other, but if you get benefits, then the 
other side is liable for attorney's fees, and I assume 
you™ll be able to work out the amount
 If you don't, he's done
 End of case
 Sent back to the administrator
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, on the research that we have done, most district courts hold 
jurisdiction on remands such as this, and we believe 
that is the proper course
 When the case -- the gravamen of the case is a complaint for benefits, the district court 
merely remands to the ERISA claims administrator, the 
merits of the case simply have not been decided
  
 JUSTICE BREYER: That may be, but why can't they do this? What would be wrong with this heretical idea, that as long as the plaintiff wins something out 
of the court, the district judge -- that group of people 
we were talking about -- has discretion to decide 
whether ultimately they got something significant of 
what they wanted, and as long as that judgment helped 
them get them something significantly of what they 
wanted, attorney's fees are fine; and we leave it all up 
to the district judge as long as the district judge 
doesn't abuse the discretion that that standard gives 
him? What would -- I mean, would the Earth come to an end? What would happen that would be so terrible if we said something like that? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I believe that would be to embrace the catalyst theory that this Court 
rejected in  --JUSTICE BREYER: It didn't say anything against the catalyst theory
 It said you have to remember this is an American country, we follow the 
American rule, and there has to be something special in 
the situation
 And what would be special in this situation is that the judge has to decide that as a 
result of the favorable ruling, the plaintiff really did 
 get something significantly of what she wanted
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the Court was careful in Ruckelshaus to say that a purely procedural 
victory would not suffice
 Now, purely procedural victory may well -- may well result in success for a 
plaintiff at some later stage; it could result in 
out-of-court success
 This Court has been crystal clear that we do not look for success out of court; we don™t 
look for it in interlocutory orders --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Rosenkranz, suppose the complaint was: I asked for a turnover of certain documents; they refused without reason
 And the court 
says: You™re right; you™re entitled to those documents
 It's interlocutory; there is no decision; but the only thing that the plaintiff asked for the 
plaintiff got, that is entitlement to the documents
 
The court said: You are entitled to the documents
 And then it goes back, and the documents are turned over 
because the court has ordered that
 Under your theory, because there was no determination of benefits, even that ruling which was a 
total victory for the plaintiff doesn't open the door to 
fees
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: On your hypothetical, Your  
 Honor, that would not be an interlocutory order
 So if a plaintiff arrives seeking only documents and the 
district court awards her, her documents, that would be 
the end of the case, and the district court would 
properly relinquish jurisdiction, and we could evaluate, 
compare the result that the district court gave -- gave 
a plaintiff with what the plaintiff originally asked 
for
 But this is not such a case
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that would fall --even if in the end of the -- at the end of the day no --
no award is made? No benefits are awarded? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it might be proper to frame a complaint under ERISA for a purely 
procedural remedy like some documents
 That is not the main run of ERISA cases
 So in the normal case, a petitioner arrives -- a plaintiff arrives asking for 
benefits
 And --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- but you say --you called it purely procedural and you said yes, but 
that's the only thing that she asked for
 So she got it
 So she qualifies for fees
 Even though you just characterized it as purely procedural, it's a purely 
procedural ruling, but it's all she asked for --MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor --JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- so she gets benefits
  
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: -- I'm not sure that a properly framed ERISA complaint would be -- would 
be for a purely procedural result
 If one could frame an ERISA claim like that, which I think is extremely --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I'm not dealing with something obscure
 If the -- the plaintiff says, I have asked for certain documents, they withheld those 
documents with no good cause at all, and the court said: 
You™re right; turn over documents
 It's that hypothetical
 It's just --that's the situation
 There is a final order: Turn over the documents
 But it's a procedural order, right? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, nonetheless, benefits would be -- nonetheless, fees would be available? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, our position is that in this case the remand order was both purely 
procedural and interlocutory
 So it fails under both those grounds
 On your hypothetical, the -- the order would be a final order, but presumably still purely 
procedural, and so perhaps not success on the merits 
even on that hypothetical
 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if --JUSTICE GINSBURG: You™re changing -- you™re changing the answer
 The answer that you first gave 
 me was it's a discrete issue -- final judgment, yes, 
qualifies for fees
 Now you™re saying no, no fees? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it would qualify in the sense that it would be a final judgment, 
not an interlocutory order
 Whether that™s properly characterized as a purely procedural victory or not, I'm 
not sure
 Most ERISA claims are not framed that way
 They are usually framed as claims for benefits, not for 
purely procedural --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the claim were: They're just not processing my application
 So, Court, order them to process my application
 Right; they™re not doing anything; we order then to go process the 
application
 End of case in the district court
 Fee entitlement? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Again, Your Honor, that would perhaps be best characterized as a purely 
procedural victory even though it's a final judgment and 
even though it™s what the plaintiff sought
 Again, in this case, this order was purely interlocutory, and so 
it's a much easier case
 This -- in this case, this was a procedural step on the road to a final judgment
 This was not a final judgment at all and not at all what the 
petitioner sought
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The government in response  
 to questions about the significance and the consequences 
of its position said, oh, this is a unique statute
 
ERISA -- it's is an ERISA statute
 Do you agree that if -- if we rule for you, it would be applicable primarily to ERISA and it 
wouldn't have an effect on these other statutes? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: No, Justice Kennedy, I don't
 The Court has oftentimes emphasized that fee-shifting statutes ought to be read in parallel, that 
we ought to have fewer rather than more fee-shifting 
standards in the world
 And so, presumably, the result in this case would govern any number of fee-shifting 
statutes of similar language
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the parties -- to follow up on Justice Ginsburg's line of 
questioning, what if the parties decide, look, this case 
rises or falls on the discovery issue? If we have to go through discovery, it's going to cost us a lot more than 
to pay you
 So we stipulate whatever the ruling is on discovery will decide the issue
 In that case, can the party -- can the claimant get fees? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: I'm sorry, Your Honor
 In this hypothetical, the district court grants the 
discovery order, but the -- but still holds jurisdiction  
 over the case? CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it grants the discovery order, and as a result, a direct result of that 
ruling, the plan pays benefits
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor
 I believe that this Court has rejected the direct results theory 
and has instructed us to look at the content of judicial 
judgments, not at their ancillary effects on parties out 
in the world
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what is the difference between prevailing party and some success 
on the merits for you? The only difference is whether they won on one cause of action as opposed to four? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, in Ruckelshaus, the Courts emphasized that omitting words like 
"prevailing party" or "success" from a statute is 
significant, but it's not revolutionary, that what it 
accomplishes is a decrease in the quantum of success 
required -- the degree, I believe was the Court's 
language -- but not the type of success required
 But it was still --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So under Buckhannon,  percent only entitles you to fees
 And under your view of this statute, you have -- as long as you get 
 percent order, that's enough
  
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the -- the Court in Ruckelshaus was speaking of the interpretation of 
ﬁprevailing partyﬂ that -- that held sway in circuit 
courts in the s
 At that time, ﬁprevailing partyﬂ had been read quite narrowly to require substantially prevailing, and 
the Court understood Congress to reject that standard in 
adopting a statute that doesn't include language like 
"prevailing party
" Subsequently, this Court has adopted a much more liberal understanding of the words 
"prevailing party," so there may not be --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you -- you see no difference today? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: There may still be a difference, but it will be a smaller difference and a 
difference only in quantity, certainly not a difference 
in type
 The result -- the success still has to be success that you can find in a judgment of a court
 Your Honors, if I could -- Your Honors, as a matter of policy, the plaintiffs have argued that this 
will result in -- that -- I'm sorry
 As a matter of policy, the plaintiffs -- or the Petitioner's rule would 
result in a second major litigation over attorney's 
fees, and this Court has rejected any such rules
 The concern is that the fee-shifting inquiry ought to be 
 simple and easy to administer
 The ease of administrability of our rule is that it turns on the contents of judicial judgments
 If the Petitioner wins in this case, the policy result will 
merely be stingier plans
 So these are not plans that any private party is obliged to create, and this Court 
has emphasized that the purpose of ERISA is to balance 
the interests of beneficiaries, on the one hand, but also 
the interest in the creation of these plans and the 
generosity of these plans, on the other
 And a fee award under circumstances like this would result in far less 
generous plans for -- for --JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? You rely very heavy on Ruckelshaus, which of course was 
a case in which the fees were sought to be imposed against 
the government
 Is there a basis for distinguishing on a sort of a sovereign immunity approach for saying that 
maybe there should be a stricter standard when you™re 
taking money away from the sovereign than when you™re 
taking it away from private litigants? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I don't think so
 The Solicitor General is here arguing that this ought to be the rule, and it would presumably be the 
same rule even in a statute that applied against the  
 government
 Again, this Court has cautioned against a proliferation of different fee-shifting standards
 I would think there would be a concern about having a 
different standard applied to the government than to a 
private party on -- on similar statutory text
 
Certainly, no indication in this statutory text --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's a trust -- trust law is at issue here, is the government's assertion
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I agree with you that it seems artificial in a way to apply those --
to apply -- to import those principles entirely
 On the other hand, this Court has emphasized that ERISA is 
informed by trust principles
 And under Sprague, the Court emphasized that trust principles would very rarely 
shift fees in a context like this
 So to that extent, I do believe that this provision should be informed by 
this Court's holding on that point
 Just to re-emphasize, Your Honors, what actually happened in the district court below: So the Petitioners sought judgment as a matter of law for 
benefits, and that motion was denied
 Instead, she received an interlocutory procedural order, a remand to 
her adversary, a private party in litigation, to 
consider the question again
 And, as this Court emphasized, the second  
 inquiry by the claims administrator would be reviewed 
for abuse of discretion
 It could easily have come out the other way, as the district court itself 
acknowledged
 JUSTICE BREYER: You also received -- she also received a conditional judgment in her favor
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: The district court specified that if Reliance did not comply with this 
procedural --JUSTICE BREYER: She said: Unless this order goes into effect within  days, the judgment will 
be entered for the plaintiff, for her -- for her
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor
 That's true, but I don't think that distinguishes this from --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, she got one judgment in her favor
 It was a conditional judgment
 I mean, if we™re being technical, if we™re going to just do 
this totally on some kind of procedural theory of what's 
a judgment, what's a judgment in your favor, and we just 
don't want to look to the merits of it and see what 
really happened, then why doesn't she win? Because she got a judgment in her favor, okay? End of the matter
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, she didn't actually get a judgment
 She got a --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, let's read the  
 judgment
 Let's see
 It says -- it says judgment
 It says in a -- what is it called? I just saw it here
 My colleague had it here
 It says -- I think this it
 It says ﬁConclusionﬂ -- it says -- and it's in the conclusion, and it says what happens
 And it says it denies, denies, denies, denies
 And then it says: "Reliance to act on Ms
 Hardt's application, adequately considering all the 
evidence, within  days
 Otherwise, judgment will be issued in favor of Mrs
 Hardt
" Now, that's in a kind of judgment, I guess
 It's in an order
 So an order saying we™ll issue a judgment -- it sounds to me like you could say that's a judgment in her favor
 You don't have to, but you could
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I think that's only -- the district court was only saying what is implicit in most all procedural orders --JUSTICE BREYER: No
 Normally, a judge -- a judge doesn't say: It is ordered that if you do not act within  days, there will be a judgment entered in flavor of the plaintiff
 That's not a usual thing
 MR
 ROSENKRANZ: But, Your Honor, if a party ignores the procedural order of a district court, it does so often on peril of default
 So it -- 
 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm just saying, if we™re going to be formal and we™re going to look to certain 
words included in -- in certain papers, irrespective of 
what really happened, don't we have those words in the 
paper that's relevant here? MR
 ROSENKRANZ: Again, Your Honor, the district court did not decide the merits of this case
 
The district court offered the possibility that it would 
enter judgment if something happened in the future
 
That thing did not happen in the future
 There was no judgment in her favor in this case
 Again, the issue was remanded to a private party to determine the issue
 
The grant of benefits on remand certainly could not 
constitute success on the merits
 That was not judicial action at all
 That was the action of a private party
 Purely voluntary action
 Certainly, couldn't constitute a judgment under Rule 
 And then when the case arrived back at the district court, the district court did the only thing 
that it was left to do, which was to dismiss the case
 And those are the actual actions the district court took: denying the motion for summary judgment and dismissing the case
 And under this Court's precedents, where we look for success is in those 
judgments
 Those judgments show us no success on the 
 merits for Ms
 Hardt
 If there are no further questions --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 Mr
 Ates, you have  minutes remaining
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R
 ATES ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR
 ATES: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I have two points on rebuttal: Under their we must have a final judgment on the benefits on her 
claim for -- final judgment on the merits on her claim 
for benefits, that is absolutely foreclosed by this 
Court's decision in Schaefer, where a Social Security 
claimant comes forward, shows a violation by the 
Secretary; it's remanded back to the Secretary; the case 
is closed at that point
 There was no decision on the merits for the benefits, and yet this Court found that 
was prevailing party
 Here, we don't need prevailing party, but moreover, even accepting their theory, it leads to absurd 
results
 There is a provision in ERISA, (c), that gives a claimant the right to seek documents
 And yet, they are saying if the claimant is wholly 
successful to get the plan document from which certain 
claims you don't even know if you have until you read  
 of itself be enough --JUSTICE SCALIA: But you could use it as evidence if there™s other evidence supporting that
 
Couldn't you? MR
 FRIEDMAN: Your Honor, you would have to look at the objective manifestation of mutual assent
 
For example, in this agreement --JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you can answer that yes or no
 Can you use that in addition to other evidence to show that the agreement was not voluntary? MR
 FRIEDMAN: Justice Scalia, I don't think so
 I think you would have to look to what transpired at the time the agreement was actually entered into and 
was made
 JUSTICE STEVENS: And that's no matter how one-sided? I mean, suppose the agreement provided that the employee shall pay all the costs of arbitration no 
matter who wins and also at the end of the arbitration 
shall pay a penalty if he fails to -- it seems to me you 
could have a really one-sided -- that would not be 
admissible on the issue? MR
 FRIEDMAN: Justice Stevens, if there is an issue about arbitral access, as in there is a block 
at the door, you cannot get a ticket to the show, 
because of some impediment in getting to arbitration in  
 the first place, under the Court's principles announced 
in Randolph and in First Options, you must have access to 
the arbitrator
 So in your example, if there is something prohibiting access to the arbitrator, that 
would be a different story
 Getting back to Justice Scalia's question about the --JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the specific examples he gave, that the -- just take that the -- that 
the employee must bear all the costs of the arbitration, 
win or lose, that's the provision
 Would that provision be enough to make the issue one for the court rather 
than the arbitrator? MR
 FRIEDMAN: Justice Ginsburg, if it's simply a complaint about the fairness, it would not be
 
If the parties --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is it? We don't need the "if
" Tell me whether you think a provision saying the employee under any and all circumstances pays all 
costs -- would that provision make this question of 
unconscionability one for the court rather than the 
arbitrator? MR
 FRIEDMAN: It could, Justice Ginsburg
 It would not be a question of arbitrability if the party 
opposing arbitration can meet the very heavy burden  
 established in Randolph to show that the fees would 
be -- would prohibit them from actually getting to 
arbitration
 It would not be simply an attack as we saw here, with no evidence, that we think a term is unfair
 The party opposing arbitration would have to meet their burden
 They would have to put evidence in
 And, for example, in Randolph the Court stated that in 
certain instances Mrs
 Randolph could have put evidence 
in, and had she put evidence in, which she did not, much 
as in this case, if she had met her burden to show that 
she could not have access to arbitration -- in other 
words, if arbitration is an illusory remedy -- that 
could be for the court to decide, because, after all, 
even in the First Options decision, the anticipation is 
you have a clear and unmistakably delegation that the 
arbitrator will make a decision, and implicit in that 
that there is an arbitrator to make that decision
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's -- that™s true
 The thing I was wondering in this case is there's a -- a 
dispute that's about racial discrimination and so forth
 
There™s a clause, and the clause says this is 
arbitrable, but that is being disputed because the 
plaintiff in the case says that's an unconscionable 
provision, so it doesn't really apply
 And then you say but now that dispute is referred to the arbitrator to  
 just read the language
 But the plaintiff says that that language, too, is unconscionable, and as long as 
that language is unconscionable, then how is it clear 
and unmistakable that they, he, agreed to do it, because 
an unconscionable provision is not a provision? So if we apply First Options -- I mean, it's complicated because of the language; it's not 
complicated once you think it out, and -- I hope
 But just applying it very literally, it would seem to say 
that you do not have clear and unmistakable evidence 
that they agreed to submit this kind of dispute to 
arbitration for the reason that what you point to is 
itself according to them a product of unconscionability
 
How do you -- how do you respond to that? MR
 FRIEDMAN: Justice Breyer, under section , which is the enforcement mechanism, the court is 
limited to make decisions about the making
 Once the making issue is not an issue -- and it has never been an 
issue in this case; there has never been an allegation 
the making has been affected -- the court at that 
point should enforce the agreement pursuant to its 
terms
 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, making itself could be, but I think that's a harder question, 
whether a -- certainly if the person says you see my  
 signature there; that's not mine; that's Joe Banana's, 
who tries to imitate me -- there is no contract, and no 
matter what it says, it doesn't go to the arbitrator
 
All right? Now, we can argue about whether it is or is not analogous to that when he claims it's 
unconscionable
 There's a very good argument it is analogous
 There's a very good argument it is like fraud in the inducement, and there are some arguments 
the other way
 But First Options I think cuts through that, by saying whether that's true or not, unless it's clear 
and unmistakable that they wanted this matter, the 
matter of whether the arbitration clause itself is 
unconscionable referred to the arbitrator, whether or 
not they wanted that referred to the arbitrator has to 
be clear and unmistakable
 And they are claiming no, because the lack -- the provision that says that is 
itself a product of unconscionability
 That's to repeat my question
 But, having repeated the question, why isn't that the simplest, most direct, and four-sentence 
ground for deciding this case? MR
 FRIEDMAN: Justice Breyer, Jackson, first and foremost, did not ever complain that the arbitrability 
provision, the clear and unmistakable delegation provision,  
 is unconscionable
 JUSTICE BREYER: He™s not saying that this whole arbitration clause is unconscionable? MR
 FRIEDMAN: He™s complaining that generally it's unconscionable --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, all right
 So he's -- he™s complaining the whole clause is unconscionable, 
and that's part of the clause
 MR
 FRIEDMAN: Justice Breyer, this is really very similar to First Options, in which the party said: 
I'm not party to the agreement; the scope does not 
cover --JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and in First Options, we said it wasn™t clear and unmistakable
 MR
 FRIEDMAN: The Court said it was not, but in First Options the Court set out the rule --JUSTICE BREYER: And the rules were what I just described
 MR
 FRIEDMAN: The rule is -- in this case, there is language that has never been contested, and that 
language clearly and unmistakably says that the 
arbitrator has exclusive authority
 That language has never been attacked
 And as to the issue of unconscionability, pursuant to section , which gives the court the  
 authority to send the arbitration to the arbitrator, the 
court should do exactly that
 It should send it to the arbitrator once the making issue is satisfied, and then 
the arbitrator can make that decision
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your position is that the arbitrator gets to decide questions of 
unconscionability, but the court gets to decide whether 
the arbitrator can do that? MR
 FRIEDMAN: In some instances, Justice Roberts -- Mr
 Chief Justice, that is correct
 The court must decide whether the agreement is made
 The court must also decide whether there was a clear and 
unmistakable delegation
 So under First Options and the cases that interpret it and the cases before it, the 
court must make the initial determination of whether 
there is a clear and unmistakable delegation
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do you understand --and we can ask the Respondent
 But, as you understand Jackson's case, is he saying that part of the clause, 
part of the arbitration clause, is unconscionable, that 
the whole clause is unconscionable or that the whole 
contract is unconscionable? MR
 FRIEDMAN: He has made generalized --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because the complaint is a bare-bones complaint, and I don't know if there™s  
 anything in the pleadings that reflects what his answer 
to that question would be
 MR
 FRIEDMAN: Justice Kennedy, he has attacked certain provisions specifically of the 
agreement
 He is arguing about the discovery provision
 He is arguing about the fees provision
 And he is arguing about certain terms excluding claims, that bilaterally 
exclude claims
 So he has attacked about three provisions of the agreement specifically
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But all of the arbitration agreement, not the employment contract as a 
whole
 MR
 FRIEDMAN: Justice Ginsburg, it is a stand-alone four-page arbitration agreement
 And --JUSTICE BREYER: So let's go back to that
 Maybe the other way is simpler
 You say you agree that if my defense to this contract, which you are trying to 
enforce against me or which gives me a right to sue you, 
look at the argument, you put up this four-page 
document, and I say: Look, that is not my signature; that is the signature of Joe Bananas
 We agree that's for the court
 MR
 FRIEDMAN: We agree, Justice Breyer
 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay
 Now, we agree it's for the court if my defense is, what he did is he got me  
 drunk, told me a bunch of lies, and I signed it
 I grant it's my signature, but look at how squiggly it is
 
And my will was not a free one because I was under the 
influence of alcohol and lies
 MR
 FRIEDMAN: We agree --JUSTICE BREYER: Okay
 Same
 Okay
 That™s Prima Paint
 MR
 FRIEDMAN: -- because that™s part of the fraud issue
 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay? Now, he says the reason that I did not sign this contract -- I 
agree it's my signature; I agree it is not squiggly -- but 
still my will was overborne
 What was it overborne by? It was overborne by those very situations that lead 
courts to label contracts unconscionable
 The reason we don't enforce unconscionable contract is because the 
person who was the victim had no free will
 He did not sign it of his own accord
 And that doesn't -- there™s no other reason, and that's the basic reason, and 
therefore assimilate it to the other two
 What's your response? MR
 FRIEDMAN: No, Justice Breyer, that would be a very different situation
 That would be allegations of procedural unconscionability, unequal 
bargaining power, and in fact -- 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree that a contract cannot be unconscionable unless it was coerced, 
that a finding of unconscionability is the same as a 
finding of coercion? You don't agree with that, do you? MR
 FRIEDMAN: No, there could be other types of unconscionability
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but that's what I want the answer to
 I know you don't agree with it
 What I want is a list of reasons why
 MR
 FRIEDMAN: With respect to procedural unconscionability, issues of unequal economic bargaining 
power, which is essentially what we have here -- those are 
non-issues that cannot be addressed by the arbitrator
 
And, in fact, under Nevada law, Justice Breyer, an 
allegation of procedural unconscionability, no matter 
how procedural --JUSTICE BREYER: But I'm not interested in arbitration law
 I™m interested in contract law, and I want to know why as a general matter of contract law an 
allegation of unconscionability, defense of 
unconscionability, is why is it not enough like the 
coercion defense or the inducement defense or the "I was 
in Alaska" defense? Isn't it enough like that that they should be treated alike? And now you're going to say no, and I want to know why not
 
 MR
 FRIEDMAN: It does not rise to the same level as something that's fraudulent or something that 
is forced with a gun to your head
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought the answer to your -- the answer to your answer would be, 
well then, the -- you™re more likely to win on that 
question
 Obviously, you are going to lose on the gun to the head, but if it™s simply the economic inequality or 
whatever, under the State law you™re probably going to 
prevail, and they will say there is a valid contract
 I thought the -- your -- your whole point was simply it's 
all or nothing
 The courts get to decide is there a valid contract or is there not
 And once they decide there is, then everything else about unconscionability of 
particular clauses is for the arbitrator
 MR
 FRIEDMAN: Mr
 Chief Justice, most everything is for the arbitrator, and I want to 
distinguish between unconscionability, as Justice Breyer 
is referring to, and access issues and issues that go to 
the making, because there is a very bright line
 Making issues go to the actual formation, mutual assent, and 
there is obviously no mutual assent if you have a gun to 
your head
 But issues such as, well, this is unfair, I 
 may have to do this, speculation is simply not enough 
to -- to pertain to the making of the agreement, nor is 
an issue about an impossibly burdensome access to the 
arbitration
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Friedman, this contract is -- is unusual in that, as Judge Hall said, 
it was more employee-friendly than most
 It had a clause -- it had a provision for back-end review with 
the court
 The review -- at the end of the line, there was to be court review, and as the parties said, it 
should be just like review of a district court decision, 
a much -- much more focused review than would be in the 
case of an arbitration agreement
 Now, that clause comes out because of our decision in Hall
 That leaves the -- the arbitration agreement in -- in an imbalance
 There was court review assured at the back end
 So why isn't it reasonable to say the parties contemplated vigorous court review; if 
it can't be had at the back end, it should be had at the 
front end? MR
 FRIEDMAN: Justice Ginsburg, there will be court review at the end pursuant to section 
 As a result of Hall Street, section  is now the exclusive 
basis on the tail end -- 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was very limited review
 But the parties to this agreement put in a clause that provided for the standard review, not the 
very limited review that the Arbitration Act calls for
 MR
 FRIEDMAN: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg
 But by operation of law and because of this Court's decision in Hall Street, now the parties 
will receive the section  review, much as they would 
in the First Options case
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Once again, has this argument been made here? I thought that the only basis was unconscionability
 I suppose you could have made the argument that the contract is void because one of 
its essential provisions has been rendered unlawful and, 
therefore -- and is not severable, and, therefore, the 
whole contract fails
 I suppose you could make that argument
 That hasn't been made, has it? MR
 FRIEDMAN: Justice Scalia, that's absolutely correct
 There has been no argument, in fact, at no time -- and it would have -- the proper 
place would have been the district court -- was any 
evidence ever put into the record --JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could it be in the district court? We didn't decide Hall Street until after the district court was finished in this case
 
 MR
 FRIEDMAN: But, Justice Ginsburg, at the district court no evidence of any sort attacking any 
provision
 The only attacks here on the provisions are the arguments that were made by my colleague in the 
brief --JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you were making, in answer to Justice Scalia, the question -- he 
said, well, they didn't raise it
 They didn't raise that with this provision out, it was an essential 
provision, so the contract was void
 They had no reason to make that in the district court because Hall Street 
was not yet decided
 MR
 FRIEDMAN: Justice Ginsburg, my point simply is they put in no evidence of any sort attacking 
anything
 We™re simply --JUSTICE SCALIA: Can they make it here now? Can they make -- I mean, even if they had -- you know, 
even if there was no reason to make it in the district 
court, is the law --MR
 FRIEDMAN: I -- I --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that since they didn't have an opportunity to make it in the district court, 
they can make it in the Supreme Court? MR
 FRIEDMAN: Justice Scalia, they could make that argument before the arbitrator, and the 
 arbitrator could make that decision
 Under the clear and unmistakable delegation, that issue, like other 
issues, should be decided by the arbitrator
 Nobody is contesting -- at least certainly nobody contested prior to us getting to the Supreme 
Court -- both the district court and the Ninth Circuit 
held that the language was clear and unmistakable
 
There was never any contest to that issue until we got 
here
 And because of the clear and unmistakable language and because the agreement does not implicate the making, 
we asked the court to enforce the terms of the agreement 
as written and pursuant to Bazzle and Howsam
 In particular, in Bazzle the Court recognized that issues as 
to scope and issues as to validity can go to the 
arbitrator in the first instance
 Here, there can be no doubt -- and certainly there was no doubt at the district court level and Ninth 
Circuit -- that the parties clearly and unmistakably gave 
the arbitrator exclusive authority
 And we™re asking the Court to give effect to that language
 The -- the -- the primary purpose of the Federal Arbitration Act is to enforce arbitration 
agreements pursuant to their terms
 Here, there's no real dispute about what the terms are
 Under section , a limited inquiry, once we have satisfied section  the  
 court should proceed to send us to the arbitrator
 Nobody is arguing that Mr
 Jackson can't make these challenges once he gets to arbitration
 In fact, he certainly can
 And the arbitrator will make that decision
 And the arbitrator may decide that it is unconscionable, in which case he™ll set it down
 Or he may decide -- or he or she may decide that it™s not 
unconscionable, or he or she may decide that certain 
terms are problematic and to sever those
 At this point, if there™s no other questions, I™d like to reserve my remaining my time
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 Mr
 Silverberg
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN E
 SILVERBERG ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MR
 SILVERBERG: Thank you, Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Petitioner would have the Court adopt a rule whereby agreements to arbitrate are presumed 
enforceable before their validity has been determined by 
a court under section  of the Federal Arbitration Act
 
They would have people like Mr
 Jackson waive their 
right to go to court through the use of a clause 
delegating this judicial function to the arbitrator
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you describe for  
 us what is unconscionable about this contract? What is your claim of unconscionability? He says it's not arbitration per se; it's just certain of the provisions 
here; if you change the provisions, I'm happy with 
arbitration
 Is that your position? MR
 SILVERBERG: Yes, Your Honor, that --that what is unconscionable about this is it's unusually 
one-sided in that the issues that are most important to 
Mr
 Jackson, such as his racial discrimination case, he 
is required to arbitrate, but those issues that might be 
most important to the Petitioner, such as trade secrets 
and unfair competition, they are not bound to arbitrate
 
So --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought the issue would be -- it's odd to say, I think, that if 
you have  provisions, some are unconscionable and 
some are not
 The issue would be whether there is unconscionability in the making of the whole contract
 
In other words, it's the same question I asked your 
friend: Why isn't it all or nothing? If it was -- if there was no unconscionability in the making, then the 
arbitrator decides
 If there was unconscionability in the making, then -- then the arbitrator doesn't decide 
anything
 Questions  through , not simply, you know,  
 , , and 
 MR
 SILVERBERG: If I understand Your Honor's question, the -- the threshold determination 
must first be made by the court under section  as to 
whether there is unconscionability either of the entire 
agreement or any of the provisions
 It would then, assuming that were found, that some provisions were in 
fact unconscionable, it would be on State law to 
determine whether or not the entire agreement gets 
thrown out --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, my point is that once you get past that gateway question of whether the 
formation of the contract was not unconscionable, then 
claims that particular provisions were unconscionable 
are by definition for the arbitrator to decide
 MR
 SILVERBERG: No, we would disagree with that, and here's why, Your Honor, and I think this goes 
to something that Justice Sotomayor asked, which is it 
creates a very difficult rule to deal with
 The Petitioners here, one, they have made a huge concession, 
we believe, in their reply brief by saying that if there™s 
an illusory remedy, that that is a section of 
unconscionability that the court can hear and must hear
 
But all these other --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is that -- why is  
 that a big concession, because I thought, as the First 
Circuit said, if argument is the -- the contract is 
illusory, that goes to the court, but here the only 
claim is unconscionability
 That's a question of fairness
 It doesn't go to the court
 MR
 SILVERBERG: The -- the reason it's a concession is because that's not their original position 
and that's not the question that they presented to this 
Court
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if they -- if they made that concession, so what, under the First Circuit's 
reading? MR
 SILVERBERG: The First Circuit, Your Honor, we believe did not interpret this correctly
 
They have, we believe, carved out a section of 
unconscionability law at the exclusion of all other 
unconscionability law
 We know that States and Federal courts have routinely applied State unconscionability law, and they 
would have a rule whereby all this jurisprudence of the 
States delineating unconscionability law would in 
essence be preempted
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that -- is that right? Is the arbitrator free to decide unconscionability in a 
vacuum without taking into account State law at all?  
 And doesn't he get reviewed afterwards by the State 
court on the basis of a much more lenient standard 
than -- than if the court decided it de novo
 But can he really disregard State law regarding 
unconscionability? MR
 SILVERBERG: Well, the problem is, Your Honor, and if I understand Your Honor's question 
correctly, that determination must of course be made by 
the court, because the arbitrator doesn't have any 
authority to do anything until the requirements of 
section  are met
 And I hope I™m understanding Your Honor's question
 JUSTICE SCALIA: No -- I mean, you -- I thought you were saying that if we allow this to go to 
the arbitrator, the arbitrator can simply disregard the 
question of unconscionability
 MR
 SILVERBERG: That -- in essence, yes
 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's not my understanding
 My understanding is that he's -- he is obliged to take account of State law regarding 
unconscionability, but it's going to be his call, as it 
would be the district judge's call if this had gone to 
court, whether in fact this is unconscionable
 
Afterwards, there will be court review
 And if he has totally disregarded all State law regarding  
 unconscionability, wouldn't -- wouldn't you have a basis 
to set aside the -- the arbitration? MR
 SILVERBERG: Respectfully, I -- I disagree with that, and here's why, Your Honor: The back-end review -- presumably it would be, I believe, 
under section (a)() that he exceeded his authority
 
And once the arbitrator is empanelled under the 
Federal -- under section , once he is authorized to 
make any decisions at all, including the issue that the 
Petitioner would have him decide of unconscionability 
and arbitrability, it would be impossible for anyone to 
say he has exceeded his authority
 JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't mean -- does that mean he can disregard -- let's assume the contract 
is a contract to maim
 I mean, it -- you know, it's --it's like -- it's a Shylock contract, okay? He's going to be able to exact a pound of flesh
 Now, there are State laws which invalidate contracts to maim
 Do you think that the arbitrator can ignore that, and say, 
well, you know, I don't really think it's so bad; a 
pound of flesh sounds reasonable to me? MR
 SILVERBERG: I think the concern is, Your Honor, and it's hard to draw the line --JUSTICE SCALIA: Can he ignore the State law?  
 MR
 SILVERBERG: I think there™s no adequate review if he chooses to without the court's 
review of --JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that right? You don't think a State court would in the blink of an eye set 
aside an arbitration that allowed a -- a pound of flesh? MR
 SILVERBERG: Your Honor, I would hope they would, but I -- in reading the narrow review of 
section , , and , I don't think we have that 
guarantee
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you have a misunderstanding of the law, then, if that's what you 
believe
 I -- I think there™s no doubt what would happen in that case
 JUSTICE BREYER: What is -- what I'm not sure about what you are arguing now is my -- as I came into 
this, I thought there were three situations
 Situation  is common in labor arbitration
 It's an arbitration agreement that says wages, hours, and working conditions 
disputes will be arbitrated, and we have a question 
about whether a particular dispute is or is not full 
within the definition
 MR
 SILVERBERG: Right
 JUSTICE BREYER: As to that one, we assume that the parties intended the question of arbitrability 
 to be arbitrated; we assume it
 Normally, that's the rule
 It's the scope of the arbitration agreement
 That's a little hard to distinguish, but sometimes 
that's not the argument
 The argument could be: Well, there are four different provisions in the arbitration 
section, and we think one of them is void because it's, 
say, unconscionable, but the others are okay
 Now, that one, I mean, normally, you could if it's clear enough 
say I want that one to go to arbitration
 And the third one is that you have a contract, and it's an arbitration contract, and it's on 
four separate pieces of paper, and what you™re saying 
is, I was in Alaska, or the equivalent, and maybe 
unconscionability is the equivalent
 On that one I'm with you
 I don't see how you can submit -- agree to submit that to the arbitrator, because there™s no 
agreement, or at least no valid one, at least no valid 
one under State law
 But what are you arguing? That this is that case or this is the other case I just mentioned, that 
middle case where you have  provisions and you™re 
saying that this one over here is unconscionable but 
that one isn't; and -- but I did sign a valid 
arbitration agreement
 I agree with that
 It's just that  
 certain provisions of it are invalid because they™re 
unfair
 What are you arguing in this case? MR
 SILVERBERG: That -- Your Honor, it would be the second one
 That there are issues --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the second one -- I don't see how you get there, because if it's the second, 
one you concede that there is an arbitration agreement 
that™s valid
 And if you concede that there is a valid arbitration agreement between you and your client, and 
you™re arguing over the scope of different provisions 
or whether certain provisions within it are valid or 
invalid, why can't you submit that to an arbitrator if 
it™s clear enough? MR
 SILVERBERG: But we don't concede that, Your Honor
 That's the whole point, is that the court must make that threshold determination
 JUSTICE BREYER: As to each provision? As to each bit of -- why? MR
 SILVERBERG: Because that's the mandate of section 
 The arbitrator derives his authority --JUSTICE BREYER: But suppose you and your --your client -- rather, your client and the other side have 
absolutely agreed, clear as could be, under the 
arbitration agreement: We want arbitrated too whether the provision that these words are contained in is  
 unconscionable
 Can't they agree to that? MR
 SILVERBERG: Your Honor, the parties are -- don't necessarily have to take every issue to court, but should a party challenge that issue as unconscionable, that door should remain open
 This case is not so much -- it is about our case here, but there™s a bigger picture here
 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay
 Let me say it more easily
 We have agreement number one, four pages, and within it is a question of -- which just looks like this 
one
 Agreement number two: The two parties agree that if any dispute should arise as to whether any words in 
agreement number one are unconscionable, they will go to the arbitrator
 Agreement number two is concededly valid
 Now do you want to say that agreement number one -- those words have to be decided by the court? MR
 SILVERBERG: Your Honor, it is our position that -- that the threshold determination as to the validity of the contract --JUSTICE BREYER: Right, but if you™re going to say yes --MR
 SILVERBERG: -- would go the court
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- then I think if you™re going to say yes to that, then it™s contrary to First Options, I think
 
I'm not sure, but I don't see why not
  
 MR
 SILVERBERG: Well, Your Honor, I think that what Your Honor is describing is the first part of 
First Options that looked -- and that's what the 
Petitioner would like to rely on, is objective contract 
language
 But then the Court adds the entire other section which says we don't presume that parties intend 
to arbitrate certain matters and -- because we™re not 
yet at that scope -- but we want clear and unmistakable 
language, not just objective language in the contract
 And there's an important reason for that, because it's impossible to draw the line
 You™re carving out certain issues of unconscionability --JUSTICE KENNEDY: After this --MR
 SILVERBERG: -- saying both --JUSTICE KENNEDY: After this suit was filed and both parties are going up the steps to the court, 
could the attorneys and the parties stop and say let's 
arbitrate this issue of unconscionability and pick an 
arbitrator? Could they do that? MR
 SILVERBERG: They -- I think the answer there would be yes, but the door needs to be open in 
case there is a challenge, Your Honor
 Certainly, nobody is --JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, then -- then the --MR
 SILVERBERG: -- required to go to court
 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then the employee loses
 He says: Oh, you have to have an open door; this was --this was not properly before the arbitrator
 MR
 SILVERBERG: I think if Your Honor is asking --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because, you see, if you say yes, that they can arbitrate this, then the 
question is why can't they do it when the contract's 
signed? MR
 SILVERBERG: Again, Your Honor --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume that the answer to my question is yes, they can put that to an 
arbitrator
 If that's so, how can you prevail in this case if the agreement clearly comprehends submission of 
this issue to the arbitrator? MR
 SILVERBERG: Well, we don't concede that it clearly does that
 We -- what our position is --JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- I'm asking, assume you do? MR
 SILVERBERG: I don't think that gets us around the requirements of section , Your Honor, that 
says the court and the doors to the court must always 
remain open for that
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your --MR
 SILVERBERG: I hope I™m understanding your 
 question
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Silverberg, the section  on which you place much emphasis just says 
that agreements are enforceable save on such grounds as 
exist in law or equity for revocation of a contract
 
But the section  doesn't say any -- anything about who 
decides that question
 MR
 SILVERBERG: That's true, Your Honor, the -- but the logical reading of that statute would 
indicate that these three elements -- a writing, in 
interstate commerce, and not revocable at law and 
equity -- would have to be met before the arbitrator has 
any authority to do anything
 And as Your Honor mentioned in the -- in the Doctor's Associates case, there are certain issues that 
are certainly involved, and unconscionability is one of 
those issues that can be presented to the court without 
violating section , as well as fraud and duress, I 
believe, were the other ones that the Court had -- had 
delineated in that case
 JUSTICE BREYER: I read your -- I promise you I™ll go back to First Options, which I thought was 
of gem-like clarity --(Laughter
) JUSTICE BREYER: And I am apparently the  
 only one in the world --MR
 SILVERBERG: That's because it was well argued
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- the only one in the world who thinks that
 And I™ll go back to --JUSTICE SCALIA: You wrote that, didn't you? Didn't you write that opinion? (Laughter
) JUSTICE BREYER: I™ll go back to that and look at it
 But the -- the --(Laughter
) JUSTICE BREYER: Looking at your response to their motion to arbitrate --MR
 SILVERBERG: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- it seemed to me you said here that -- that because of your -- your position, 
your client's position, that the whole thing is 
unconscionable
 You didn't say that? MR
 SILVERBERG: Well, we said that -- it was certainly my position that the entire agreement was 
unconscionable based on Nevada law --JUSTICE BREYER: Yes
 MR
 SILVERBERG: And that it was so incredibly one-sided, and also the limited discovery 
provisions, and also because, frankly, we are not  
 looking to treat this anything other than like we would 
ordinary contract law that also strikes one-sided 
provisions in -- for example, in Nevada, the Fick case, 
which would strike down a one-sided prenuptial 
agreement, or lease agreements that have one-sided 
attorney fee provisions are routinely struck down as 
one-sided
 So their position --JUSTICE KENNEDY: But which is the stronger case for arbitration? Case one, you attack the arbitration clause only, part of the arbitration 
contract only, as being unconscionable
 Case two, you attack the whole agreement as being unconscionable
 Do those both stand on the same footing, or is one a 
stronger case for submission to the court than the 
other? MR
 SILVERBERG: I think this Court has made clear in the severability cases that challenges to the 
contract as a whole would go to the arbitrator to 
decide
 We have here, as Petitioner admits to --JUSTICE KENNEDY: I find that somewhat paradoxical, but I -- I agree that that -- that that's 
the law
 MR
 SILVERBERG: So the stronger one would be an -- as this case, which we believe is very 
strong, an attack -- 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So if you do go to the State court, suppose the State court says: I can't really decide this question about the one clause unless 
I determine the conscionability or the unconscionability 
of the entire contract, and I now proceed to do that
 Do you have to wait and say: Stop, you can't do that? MR
 SILVERBERG: I think that™s what sections  and  contemplate, is for -- and they have 
been in existence since the passage of the Act -- for 
parties to come in and make their case as to whether or 
not the FAA would apply or not apply
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose the State court judge says that he has to look at the whole 
contract
 Do you say: Oh, I'm sorry to bother you; we have to go back to the arbitrator now? MR
 SILVERBERG: That's not the situation in this case, but assuming it were --JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your -- no, it's a hypothetical case
 MR
 SILVERBERG: I understand
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What would your position be in the hypothetical case, representing your client? MR
 SILVERBERG: Representing my client, who is Mr
 Jackson, I would want the court to look at the 
 whole thing, but if I were in the Petitioner's shoes I 
think I would have an argument that, based on this 
Court's precedent --JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what do you think the judge should decide as between those two possibilities? MR
 SILVERBERG: If it's an attack on the contract as a whole, it should go to the arbitrator
 I think that's clear from many of the Court's cases; 
whereas, if the attack is to the arbitration clause 
itself, that is something for the court to decide and 
determine
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I think I heard Justice Kennedy's question to be -- let's not confuse 
the contract as a whole
 There™s only one contract here
 MR
 SILVERBERG: Correct
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's an agreement to arbitrate
 MR
 SILVERBERG: Yes, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So an attack on the --as I think Justice Breyer noted, you -- an argument that 
it's one-sided goes to the entire arbitration agreement
 
I don't want to arbitrate because that's not what I 
chose to do freely
 Correct? MR
 SILVERBERG: Correct
  
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That, you say, is for the court
 MR
 SILVERBERG: Yes, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The difference here is that there are provisions within how the arbitration is 
going to be held that, standing alone, you think are 
unconscionable, even though the agreement to arbitrate 
is not
 Am I correct in understanding your allegation? MR
 SILVERBERG: No, Your Honor
 Respectfully, it™s our position that both are present
 
There are certain elements of the arbitration agreement 
that are unconscionable and, under Nevada law, which 
would render the entire arbitration agreement 
unconscionable
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You see, that's what I'm confused by, because when I first asked you this 
question, you said: I would be happy to arbitrate if the court struck the discovery provision and, I guess, 
the fees provision
 Which answer are you giving me? MR
 SILVERBERG: I™m giving you the one I just gave you, I think, Your Honor, which is we™ve got 
both certain provisions that are unconscionable, that 
under Nevada law render the entire agreement 
unconscionable --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay
 Let™s assume --
 MR
 SILVERBERG: -- and that's what the Court is to rely on
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay
 That -- now I understand that part of your argument
 But let's assume that that wasn't Nevada law, that Nevada law would say severability works, and there is an agreement to arbitrate, 
and all we have to or could do is strike the unfair provisions
 Let's assume that situation
 Who decides whether to strike the unfair provisions? MR
 SILVERBERG: That would be the court under our position, Your Honor, and that --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that can't be right
 The -- how can you say there's no problem agreeing to arbitrate, no imbalance in bargaining 
authority whatever, but then say, oh, but these 
procedures are unconscionable? It seems to me that the procedures are there, and the party, the employee, whatever, can look 
at those
 And if he says, well, that's unconscionable, you don't sign the agreement as a whole
 But once you are -- in for a penny, in for a pound
 If you agree to arbitrate, then it's at least for the arbitrator to 
decide particular provisions, whether they™re 
unconscionable
 MR
 SILVERBERG: Well --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know you™re arguing in the alternative
 But the one argument that we get to pick out the provisions we don't like and say 
those are unconscionable, but the agreement as a whole 
is not -- that seems to me illogical
 MR
 SILVERBERG: Your Honor, that is our position
 I hope I am understanding your question
 But this is a matter of State law as to which provisions 
would render the entire agreement unconscionable
 And I think that body of unconscionability law is not so 
varied that we would have unwieldy results
 I think State --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's a matter -- it may be a matter of State law, but the open 
question is who gets to decide it
 MR
 SILVERBERG: Right, and our --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Arbitrators decide matters of State law all the time
 MR
 SILVERBERG: Certainly, they do
 Certainly, they do
 But before they have that authority to even do that, the requirements, again, of section  
have to be met
 And that is our position in this matter
 That™s --JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's assume Nevada law says you cannot -- you cannot fire somebody for coming 
 in late to work any fewer than  times, all right? 
And an individual is fired
 He goes to arbitration, or at least the company tries to take him to arbitration on 
it
 And he says, no, because I was fired in violation of Nevada law
 Now, is it your position that that -- that that case would have to go immediately to court and 
could not submit to the arbitrator the issue of whether 
indeed he was fired for coming less than  times, and 
indeed whether if he was coming in less than  times, 
that would be an invalid basis for a dismissal? MR
 SILVERBERG: No, Your Honor, and here's why: I think Your Honor has described a situation similar to -- I believe that was the Green Tree 
situation, where there was an allegation that the entire 
contract was illegal, the usurious contract
 But there was no question as to the making of the agreement to 
arbitrate
 So, in Your Honor's hypothetical, if there is no dispute as to the arbitration agreement being subject 
to a ground of revocation at law or at equity as 
defined in section , then I would -- I would concede 
that that was something that would go to the arbitrator, 
Your Honor
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, your -- your position  
 seems to be that unconscionability is the same as 
coercion in the making of the agreement
 And I don't know that that's true
 MR
 SILVERBERG: Well, Your Honor, respectfully, in Doctor's Associates, I think the Court 
spoke very clearly that fraud, duress, and 
unconscionability are there and are part of something 
that can be raised under section 
 And also the Court's hold in Prima Paint --JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't care what we --MR
 SILVERBERG: -- where fraud --JUSTICE SCALIA: I don™t care what we said in dictum
 It doesn't seem to me that unconscionability is the same as duress or the same as fraud --MR
 SILVERBERG: To -- oh, I'm sorry
 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that you can -- you can be a stupid person who voluntarily signs an unconscionable 
contract
 Now, the courts may protect you because you™re stupid, but you haven't been coerced
 Is there no distinction between unconscionability and coercion? MR
 SILVERBERG: Not under section , Your Honor
 I think the -- the definition that the Petitioner would have this Court adopt, that narrow view 
of making -- again, something Justice Sotomayor 
brought up -- would create a rule where certain  
 unconscionability challenges went to the court --JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? MR
 SILVERBERG: -- and other unconscionability challenges didn't go to the court
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? I would say all unconscionability challenges, if you have an agreement 
that™s as clear as this one, would go to the arbitrator
 
Which ones would have to go to the court? MR
 SILVERBERG: All of them should go to the court, Your Honor, based on this Court's holding 
both in Doctor's Associates and Prima Paint, in that 
both fraud in the inducement, like in Prima Paint, and 
unconscionability envision a situation where you™ve 
got a formed contract that people can choose to opt out 
of
 I may be subject to a contract that was induced by fraud, but I may like the benefit of that bargain
 So I may be able to go ahead with that
 And same with an unconscionability challenge
 We™ve got an agreement that was made that -- that the 
innocent party can decide to opt out of
 And I think that™s very consistent with this Court's holding and 
with what the various State courts have been doing in 
reliance on those holdings
 JUSTICE BREYER: But not every contract
 I mean, I™ll take that argument
 I™d like to know  
 about that argument
 I™d like to know what really is the underlying, which I™ve never looked up
 What is the underlying rationale in contract law of setting aside contracts as unconscionable? Why do courts do it? What's the theory? I™d like to know that
 MR
 SILVERBERG: My understanding is that it's so unfair that it couldn't really be said that a 
party assented to -- to that
 And I think that's what --JUSTICE BREYER: See, that's what I wonder, that last part -- is it that the basic theory is we want to 
protect a group of people by -- who voluntarily entered 
into contracts by giving them the right to opt out, or is 
is that we don't think that they really meant to do it? MR
 SILVERBERG: It's the latter, Your Honor
 I think if they really chose to --JUSTICE BREYER: Okay
 On that question, or any other question, is, I would imagine, 
where we have agreement one, and the argument is maybe 
agreement one was unconscionable
 And then we enter into agreement two, and the parties in agreement two 
agree to -- to arbitrate their unconscionability dispute 
in agreement one, and there™s nothing wrong with 
agreement two, I would think that's then the question of 
unconscionability is for the arbitrator
  
 MR
 SILVERBERG: If I understand your question --JUSTICE BREYER: You said "all," and I just don't think you meant all
 But maybe you did
 That's why I asked the question
 MR
 SILVERBERG: I -- I think that the safe thing to do is to keep the door open to people, 
especially in situations like this, where there is such 
unequal bargaining power, where people are presented 
with a nonnegotiable term of their employment --JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this kind of elementary question? MR
 SILVERBERG: Yes, Your Honor
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Are there cases out there that hold that an agreement can be partially 
unconscionable, that it™s unconscionable for some 
clauses but not in its -- in its entirety? MR
 SILVERBERG: Certainly
 And I think that would be matter of State law, again, to determine 
when there --JUSTICE STEVENS: But there are cases that -- that draw that distinction? MR
 SILVERBERG: I'm sorry
 JUSTICE STEVENS: There are cases drawing that very elementary distinction? 
 MR
 SILVERBERG: I believe so, Your Honor
 I think in Nevada you would -- if we had maybe just one 
unconscionable clause, that the court might sever and 
send the rest to the -- and validate the rest of the 
arbitration agreement
 But then when -- certain -- any number of clauses, depending on State law, would make 
the entire agreement to arbitrate unconscionable
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it make a difference in response to Justice Stevens's hypothetical 
that there is a provision saying the arbitrator will 
decide the conscionability of all clauses? The arbitrator may decide that clauses  and  are 
unconscionable, but if there™s an agreement and it's 
not unconscionable that the arbitrator will decide, then 
the arbitrator decides all of them, right? MR
 SILVERBERG: If the agreement -- I think I understand your question
 If the agreement to arbitrate itself is not --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right
 MR
 SILVERBERG: -- there™s no unconscionability challenge to that, and there™s no 
other fraud in the inducement or any other thing that 
the court has mentioned it would go to the broader view 
of making the grounds for revocation, if those grounds 
for revocation are not present, then I believe the 
 arbitrator would be empowered to make those decisions, 
Your Honor
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask you just a follow-up on Justice Breyer's hypothetical to you where 
he had the first agreement and then the issue to the 
second? You said you™ve got to leave the door open
 The door open on the second agreement or on the first 
agreement? MR
 SILVERBERG: I think the door should be open on all the agreements, because until that door is 
open under section  -- as long as that door is open 
under section , then we don't have the concern about 
parties making the terms of arbitration so onerous or 
burdensome that they would not be able to even access the 
arbitral forum
 And that's really a huge concern in --in not just in this case, but in the bigger picture
 
Courts must remain open to protect people
 I would venture to say that there are many people in this room who are subject to arbitration 
agreements, and they don't even know, through --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Silverberg --MR
 SILVERBERG: Yes, Your Honor
 JUSTICE GINSBERG: -- on that, underlying your whole case I think is the notion that this is an 
adhesion contract; it's a take-it-or-leave-it contract,  
 very common in consumer, credit card agreements, in 
employment contracts, that one party has no say except 
to sign or not to sign
 Are all those contracts subject to the unconscionability argument that you™re making or 
only some of them? And if only some, which ones? MR
 SILVERBERG: I would suggest, Your Honor, that they all are subject to that
 And then we look to State law to determine, whether, for example, in 
Nevada if you™ve great procedural unconscionability 
they have the sliding scale approach based on the D
R
 
Horton case, which we have briefed, where you would 
require less of a showing of substantive 
unconscionability
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not much use signing an arbitration agreement then, not much use for the employer
 
He™s going to end up in court anyway
 Every one of them will be acknowledge as unconscionable
 So what™s the use? MR
 SILVERBERG: Well, Your Honor --JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, kiss good-bye to arbitration
 MR
 SILVERBERG: Not at all, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SCALIA: No? MR
 SILVERBERG: That door's been open under section  and  since the inception of the Act
 We are  
 advocating the status quo be maintained here, Your Honor, 
and there is no reason to suggest that there will be some 
rush to court on this
 Courts are quite capable to do this in a summary fashion
 If a party comes before the court with a baseless unconscionability challenge, I would imagine 
not only will the court dispose of it quickly, but if an 
attorney makes a routine practice of bringing baseless 
motions to the court, he™ll have his own issues to 
deal with
 So, I don't -- I -- I disagree that there will be some floodgates or that this will in any way --
to the contrary --JUSTICE SCALIA: The amici certainly claim the contrary
 The Chamber of Commerce claims that this is what™s happening and that it has been a snowballing 
effect
 MR
 SILVERBERG: We disagree with them and Your Honor, and I would cite that we have some of the 
most prestigious arbitrators in this country that have 
joined our position and recognized the courts' vital role 
in maintaining the fairness of the arbitration process 
so the public can trust it and so the weaker parties to 
these agreements can be protected, because should that 
disappear, there will be nothing to stop stronger 
parties from again sending Mr
 Jackson, who lives in  
 Reno, to Minnesota to arbitrate his claim
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, this --JUSTICE SCALIA: There --JUSTICE GINSBURG: This clause is not of that kind, and you™ve singled out three things that made it 
unconscionable
 One, the fee provision, the splitting fees, that the court rejected
 So the only two left is the one-sided aspect of it and the limited discovery
 It seemed to me that the limited discovery clause, that that was quite common to say we™re not --
we don't want to get involved in the massive discovery 
you can get in a -- in a civil proceeding
 Is there something unusual about limiting discovery to documents? MR
 SILVERBERG: There -- there is something unusual
 They™ve gone well beyond the AAA and limited discovery to one deposition and one expert, which in an 
employment case is very difficult
 Thank you, Your Honor
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 Mr
 Friedman, you have  minutes remaining
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT T
 FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR
 FRIEDMAN: Thank you, Mr
 Chief Justice
 I™m hearing terms like "safe thing to do
" And in response to -- I think it was a question from  
 Justice Scalia, I™m hearing my colleague state that 
there is concern that the arbitrator is not going to 
apply State law
 This is merely distrust of arbitrators
 This Court has rejected this bias that arbitrators cannot 
make these decisions
 And, in fact, this Court and many others have sent very, very complicated issues to the 
arbitrator to decide
 There is no reason to believe that an arbitrator, as well as a judge, cannot decide State 
law issues of unconscionability, and the arbitrator will 
have the discretion and the ability to either strike the 
entire arbitration agreement or strike certain clauses 
as he or she sees fit
 Furthermore, this type of speculation, this fear as to what the arbitrator may do, that was rejected 
in this Court's decisions in Vimar and PacifiCare, where 
the Court stated we are going to enforce this, and the 
arbitrator may do something wrong, may do something 
right, but at the tail end there will be an ability 
under section  to address it
 There is no difference there
 Additionally, this -- this analysis of unconscionability -- I want to reiterate 
unconscionability is based on a policy decision that --
that attacks an agreement that unquestionably has  
 already been made
 JUSTICE BREYER: All right
 What is the one-sentence answer, one sentence, to the thing, this is 
a very interesting case, lots of stuff in it that we 
needn't reach because irrespective of everything else, 
they in their reply, the district court, and the court 
of appeals all said these whole four pages, the whole 
four pages were unconscionable, so none of it™s 
enforceable, and all we have to decide is whether that's 
an issue for the court
 And the answer to that being not an issue for the court is what, in a sentence or 
two? MR
 FRIEDMAN: Justice Breyer, I'm sorry
 I™m going to ask you to --JUSTICE BREYER: They said, look, there™s a four-page document
 They said this four-page document is unconscionable, the product of unconscionability, and, 
therefore, don't enforce it
 That's their claim
 That issue is at least is for the court, because there is no 
valid agreement here at all, if that's right
 MR
 FRIEDMAN: No, Justice Breyer, the determination of unconscionability is for the 
arbitrator
 The -- the limited role of the court goes only to the making, not to the issue of 
unconscionability
 So the court -- 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's the way the language is written
 So I mean you may want the greater opportunity, but it says by its explicit phrase: Terms: At the date of the prisoner's -- expiration of the 
prisoner's term of imprisonment, take that day and 
subtract from it time credited towards the service of 
the prisoner's sentence
 MR
 SADY: We are going to -- the rate phrase is: Up to  days at the end of each year of the term of imprisonment
 If there is a -year term of imprisonment, that means there's  opportunities to earn  days
 
The Bureau of Prisons' math ends up with  days, 
 days less
 And the reason for that is that they do not interpret "term of imprisonment" to encompass the 
possibility of good time
 That is the only -- because you should have  blocks of  days
 Each of those blocks, you may be able to get  days
 Then it's 
 But maybe you didn't earn any time
 Then it would be a -block
 But the -- actually, the very good idea that Congress 
had was that you had an incentive at every stage of your 
term of imprisonment for good behavior
 Even if you were misbehaving early in your prison term, at the end you still have the opportunity 
 to earn  days against that last  days
 It counts for every word in the statute
 It gives every statute meaning
 And it doesn't put us in the position of giving two -- two phrases the exact same meaning in the 
same sentence
two phrases, uses of "term of imprisonment" in the same 
sentence, mean different things
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: if -- it's a very short sentence? A year and a day, in your view, is a year and a day less 
 MR
 SADY: Yes
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But  days, what do you do with that? MR
 SADY: JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes
 If -- suppose it's for -- just -- the whole sentence is  days
 MR
 SADY: If it says  days, so that the JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, 
 In other words, short of a year
 MR
 SADY: Then it -- a -day sentence would not be eligible, because we -- the parties are 
agreed that "term of imprisonment" means a sentence of 
more than a year
 So it has to be more than  days
  
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the person that gets a year and a day serves less than the person that gets 
less than a year? MR
 SADY: That is correct
 And district courts frequently address that problem
 When you have a relatively short sentence, you say: Judge, could you give us -- instead of an -month sentence, could you 
give us a year and a day sentence, so that you could 
earn the good time on that? JUSTICE SCALIA: How can you earn the good time? I mean you only earn the good time if -- if you are a good prisoner for a year
 MR
 SADY: JUSTICE SCALIA: So you are going to let him out  days before the year, even though he hasn't 
earned the good time in the year? MR
 SADY: He has
 JUSTICE SCALIA: What did he do? How has he? MR
 SADY: He has because of the last sentence in (b) that says that for the last year or 
portion of the year, that you go ahead and establish the 
two-step process
 First, you figure out the projected release date, which is a release date with maximum good 
time
 Then you make the decision about whether the 
 
of that projected release date
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but that still couldn't give him the full  days, because there's only 
 days in six weeks
 MR
 SADY: That's only a measure when you make the determination
 They -- they were recognizing that for the last period of time, or for a year and a 
day sentence, that you are not going to be able to do 
the time all the time, but you will, so that's why there 
is a special mechanism at the end
 JUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm saying the special mechanism can't give the full  days
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because they don't make it until  days before the end of the sentence
 MR
 SADY: They make it until  days at the end of the sentence, because what they do is they 
make the -- they figure out what the maximum good time 
would be, which would be  days on a  and -- on a 
year and a day sentence, and they make that 
determination earlier
 They say, okay, you have been good for that period of time
 We recognize that this is going to be a problem, the same problem you would have on a sentence  
 of  years and  months, where you have to prorate the 
credit,  days instead of , half, and then figure out 
the projected release date with  days, subtract the 
 days, and then make the determination sometime within 
the  weeks up to that last point
 So that there is a mechanism for understanding that it is -- that in the last year there 
is going -- going to be an assumption that if you are 

day , you should get the full  days
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sure there is something wrong with this predicate to this question, 
but the -- the statute allows the Bureau to make a 
determination of good time credit within  days after 
the end of each year of the sentence
 MR
 SADY: Yes
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They cannot make that determination within  days of the  days
 And so "each year of the sentence" must mean each -- the 
full year, the  days
 MR
 SADY: Our position is that the Bureau of Prisons can make its determination as it pleases
 
We -- we are asking the Court to do -- to construe a 
statute, not write a policy statement
 So we understand that there are going to be some mechanics of it
 But  
 the mechanics in this work very easily with the 
assurance that they are receiving good time credit 
against the period of the sentence imposed by the judge
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You treat each year of the sentence as the  days if there has been good 
behavior, no? MR
 SADY: Not necessarily
 We are --I'm -- if the Bureau of Prisons wants to make that 
determination at day , that's fine, as long as they 
adjust by doing exactly what the statute says: Credit 
 days, and then reset
 If you do that, you have  blocks of  days
 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why do you do have to do that? I mean you read it
 It so complicated
 Just reading this, I -- I think the language should say this: 
 years, he's got a -year sentence
 At the end of the first year you write the number  on a piece of 
paper if he has done well
 Suppose he comes in on January , okay? So January , after the first year, you write the word 
 -- the number 
 And you do that each year
 And by the time you get to the year , what you have done is 
you have got  days
 So then you subtract the  days from   
 years, and what you get is you are  days short of  
years
 So now you look at the last sentence, and what you do is you take  days, subtract that from , and 
you've got , and you simply prorate for those 
 
And you subtract that, too, so he gets another  days 
or so, or  days credit, and that's it
 And that's following the statute, it seems to me, absolutely literally
 And it also seems to me to make sense, because you don't want to give him credit 
for time he never serves
 MR
 SADY: Justice Breyer, I think it doesn't make sense, because what it does is it creates 
an 
 minimum sentence that is served, and we note 
that the sentencing table upon which every Federal 
sentence is predicated is based on  percent
 That JUSTICE BREYER: if you want to know what the sentencing commission did, 
I think the best evidence of that is you read the 
introduction to the guidelines
 And what the introduction to the guidelines says is that, roughly 
speaking, many of the sentences approximate the time 
actually served before
 Now, what to me that suggests is that the sentencing commission never considered this question
  
 And if there's something more specific than that, that 
shows they did, I would like to know what it is, because 
I don't trust memory
 MR
 SADY: Your Honor, we are relying very heavily on the supplemental report at -- at page  of 
the joint appendix that says we -- we divide it by 
 
in order to calibrate the sentencing table to include 
good time
 That means that every sentence has been calibrated based on assuming  opportunities to earn 
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the government contends it's none of the sentencing commission's 
business
 It's up to the Bureau of Prisons
 Isn't that the government's position? MR
 SADY: That is their position
 And our position is that it's -- administering the statute is 
the Bureau of Prisons's business, but deciding what the 
minimum sentence that can -- minimum time that can be 
served to satisfy a term of imprisonment is a policy 
JUSTICE BREYER: But there is nothing in there -- that's not a policy statement; that's not a 
guideline
 That's a staff conclusion
 And the staff conclusion, I think, is conflicting with what it says in 
the -- in the introduction to the guidelines, which is  
 that all of this was very approximate
 I don't see how -- how -- a court would be bound by that
 MR
 SADY: I think that the court could be advised by it in terms of knowing that we are looking at 
a harsher sentence
 Everybody is serving more time than -- the sentence that the judge imposed was -- whether it 
was advisory guidelines or mandatory guidelines, the 
sentencing table provided the initial baseline
 And that initial baseline was boosted by 
 percent, which is not an insignificant amount, and there 
is a very simple way for the court to construe the 
statute consistently throughout to conform the two, so 
that people are not serving 
 percent more time in 
custody than the sentencing table that every judge uses 
in imposing their sentence
 We are institutionalizing a harsher system in a way that doesn't meet the statutory language, 
because the statutory language says "term of 
imprisonment
" And if it's term of imprisonment,  years of a term of imprisonment, I think a reasonable plain 
meaning is that you have  opportunities to earn 
 days
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Sady, you -- you said something about  percent or  percent is a more  
 workable system than -- was it 
 percent? Do we have any information on, (A), the number of Federal prisoners who get good time and in 
that universe, the ones who get good time, how many get 
the full credit and how many get something less than the 
full  days? MR
 SADY: Justice Ginsburg, there are approximately , prisoners, and of those about 
, of them are eligible for good time credits
 My anecdotal experience is that most prisoners get most of the -- the good time credits, so 
it's not at all unusual for prisoners to achieve most of 
that
 There is some that have minor amounts, and there is a relatively smaller number, at least in my 
experience, who do not get a lot of it
 JUSTICE BREYER: Is this right? I'm -- I'm sorry to ask you this question, but I get lost in the 
math of this sometimes
 Do you remember my example I just gave, you know, with the  years you go and put it on a piece of 
paper? MR
 SADY: JUSTICE BREYER: I take it what you want is you, in -- in essence, want him to get credit for 
 days for that tenth year?  
 MR
 SADY: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes
 And the argument against that, reading the language and so forth, is, 
well, look this is an imaginary th year
 He is not actually in prison for  years
 He is going to be released sometime late in year 
 And so why should we add  days? I mean maybe it would be a nice thing because sentences are awfully long, but -- but why would 
anybody want to add  days in respect to a year that's 
never going to be served? MR
 SADY: Each year is served in the -- if you take away the  days, if you credit it towards the 
service of the sentence and do the adjustment and reset 
that we are asking the Court to do so that you have  
opportunities, then in the last year, you are -- when 
you are in -- you go to the last sentence that 
acknowledges that you are going to have to make some 
arbitrary time that you are going to, say, okay, we are 
going to decide that you have done well enough that you 
are going to be able to get the full credit for the last 
year
 But the flaw in the Bureau of Prisons is by having the  days and actual time and that that's what 
happens at the first year, that's a -day first year
 
You can only squeeze  of those in
 The prisoners look 
 at it and they see, plain statute, what was your term of 
imprisonment, how many ends of each year of a term of 
imprisonment should you have in a -year sentence
 Ten years
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the statute says that it is -- the credit, it can be received, quote, at the 
end of each year of the prisoner's term of imprisonment 
beginning at the end of the first year of the term
 MR
 SADY: Yes
 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, when does -- when is that point, in your opinion? MR
 SADY: The Bureau of Prisons probably has discretion in administering
 I'm accepting as a proposition on the day  they make that determination
 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay
 So the -- day  is the end of the first year of -- of the term of 
imprisonment? MR
 SADY: That's -- that's when they are making the determination
 If they make a determination that he is -- should receive credit, then the end of the 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: MR
 SADY: -- 
 JUSTICE ALITO: The statute says that they -- that the prisoner may receive credit at the end  
 of each year of the prisoner's term of imprisonment beginning at the end of the first year of the term
 MR
 SADY: No
 JUSTICE ALITO: And what I'm asking is, when is the end of the first year of the term within the 
meaning of that language? MR
 SADY: The meaning of that language is JUSTICE ALITO: MR
 SADY: Excuse me
 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it day , or is it day ? MR
 SADY: It depends
 And the reason it depends is because the language of the statute says 
"credit toward the service of prisoner's sentence beyond 
time served," so if you do it beyond time served and you 
give him credit towards that sentence -- the Bureau of 
Prisons is making a determination
 Once we -- they make their determination, and we respect that determination, 
we then have to go -- from the th day, back, because 
for  of those days he doesn't have to be there
 He JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: MR
 SADY: -- adjust and reset at the next 
  
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you start it at ? MR
 SADY: No
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And he now serves another year and you back him up again at the end of 
that year? MR
 SADY: Yes, that is -- that is certainly one way of mechanically doing it so that you have  
blocks of  days each as a term of imprisonment
 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you -- and you think that their system is easier? MR
 SADY: Yes
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: MR
 SADY: No, absolutely not
 their system makes -- nobody can understand the math
 JUSTICE BREYER: Another way to think, and I think probably you'll -- if you look through the records 
of the commission, they even thought about this problem, 
and the -- the -- you will see a lot of talks given by 
various people who were there, which say that for this 
reason you are bringing up, that it might have been 
thought there was no credit for the first year
 In other words, you don't cut the sentence in the first year
 You don't begin cut until the second 
 year has been served, so he has to serve  days
 Now when you point that out, that is not the Bureau of 
Prisons's interpretation, that's nobody's 
interpretation
 They're all going to let him out if it's a year and a day
 They are going to let him out several weeks before the end of the first year, aren't 
they? MR
 SADY: Yes
 There was a technical amendment
 JUSTICE BREYER: Everybody's going to do that
 Oh -- there was a technical amendment
 MR
 SADY: To address that first year, to make sure that they did that
 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what happened
 In MR
 SADY: Exactly
 JUSTICE BREYER: MR
 SADY: -- when it was at  days
 And it's interesting, so page  of the -- of the Senate 
report on this, they used the term "adjust for good 
time
" Now that -- then it was  days
 But Congress was using exact same thought as the language here that 
says that the time is -- that you give credit towards 
the service of a sentence
 And with the Court's permission I will  
 reserve the remaining time
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel
 Mr
 Wall
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B
 WALL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MR
 WALL: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Breyer, I think you stole my thunder
 I wanted to explain how the bureau does it, and you laid it out exactly right
 If you have -- and I think just looking at the language of the statute, it 
tracks perfectly
 If you have a prisoner serving a -year sentence and he comes in on January st, the end 
of his first year of imprisonment is December st, and 
on that date he gets  days taken off the back end of 
the sentence
 That cycle repeats itself for the next  years
 JUSTICE BREYER: But the trouble with that, and I'm glad to know about that technical amendment, 
MR
 WALL: Right
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- we never considered it when I was on the -- nobody thought about it at that 
time because the language was different
 But now that you had have got this language  
 now, it's hard to reconcile with that first year
 He is sentenced for a year and a day, you see
 So literally, it says calculated on January  of the next year
 But he's already been in for longer than he should be by 
that point
 So you really have to calculate it before the year ends; you have to calculate it at least by 
October
 And -- and -- and once you start calculating it before, the statute literally says, we are into a 
more complicated thing than I thought
 MR
 WALL: Well, and that's why they have the sentence at the end, as you pointed out about the 
proration
 So when the -- when the statute says, what it says -- starts by saying is, if you are serving a 
sentence of longer than a year you are eligible for good 
time credit
 So you are earning credit as you go through that first year
 Congress knew then if you had have a year and a day sentence, you wouldn't be actually serving a 
full year because of the credits bringing you below the 
year mark
 So what it does in the last sentence, it says if you are in your last year and that's a partial 
year, we prorate
 So on your th day you have earned  days of good time credit
 Those combined equal a sentence of a year and a day, and you are out after your  
 th day
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is a premise flaw there
 And that premise flaw is that you have told us that you don't earn the credit until the end of the 
year
 MR
 WALL: JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your answer about this probation is not an answer, because it's -- your 
premise is not the same
 MR
 WALL: That's why for each full year served, so for a -year sentence, you are right that 
you are making a determination at the end of the year 
for the first  years, but when you get to that ninth 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not worried about sentences that are more than  years
 I'm worried about the prisoner who is sentenced to a year and a day
 How does that proration help that individual, since they are 
not going to get the good time credit until they've 
served a year? MR
 WALL: So, the way this works is that for the prisoner sentenced to a year and a day or 
 months or  months, because they are receiving 
credit through that first year, their good time credit 
brings them below a year
 They'll never serve a full  
 year
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: MR
 WALL: JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I'm saying to you
 The whole brief says to us, they measure the entitlement to good time credit at the end of the first 
year
 MR
 WALL: Except for the last year or partial year
 And what the final sentence of B says is, credit for the last year or portion of a year of the 
term of imprisonment shall be prorated and credited 
within the last  weeks
 So for the prisoner who has a year and a day sentence, his sentence is literally all 
proration
 He is just serving a partial year
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He is not going to get  days? MR
 WALL: That's right
 On the th day he has come through about nine tenths of the year, he 
has accrued  days
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I just want to make absolutely sure because I hadn't done the math forward; 
I did the math backwards
 MR
 WALL: Right
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which was the one that  
 MR
 WALL: Right
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which is  days are earned back for each year, and you take it off the full 
term of imprisonment
 The -- you are representing to me that the math that is in your program statement is accomplishing 
that result? MR
 WALL: Absolutely
 Which is to say when the prisoner gets to his last year, if that's a partial 
year, he is not going to get the  days, he's going to 
get some portion of the  days, based on what part of a 
year he served
 And that is prorated and credited within the last  weeks
 Now, it's normally done on the release date
 So in that th year for the -year JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just interrupt with one question? If he got a total of  or whatever it is, he should never enter the th year because he would 
finish the -year sentence in less than  years
 MR
 WALL: JUSTICE STEVENS: Or less than  years, rather
 MR
 WALL: That's -- that's right
  wouldn't be quite  years, but setting that to the 

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So how does he -- how does he get his th block of good time? How does he ever MR
 WALL: Well, under the government's view he can only earn good time credit when he is actually 
incarcerated
 And what Petitioners are coming in and JUSTICE STEVENS: Right
 I understand
 But explain to me how -- how he can get more than a year of 
good time credit before the th year begins? MR
 WALL: Well, so, if you take a -year prisoner -- a prisoner with a -year sentence, the way 
it currently works, at the end of the th year he has 
accrued  days of good time credit
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which is more than a year
 MR
 WALL: Right
 So he knocked off his full th year and he's knocked off a part of his th 
year
 Now we are at that final th year, which is a prorated year
 He has got  days left and by the th day he earned  days of credit
 So he is released after the th day of his th year
 And as Justice Breyer pointed out, that precisely tracks the language of the statute
 You do it at the end of each full year until you get to the last 
partial year, and then you prorate and you do it in the 
 last  weeks
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And each of those  years included  days of credit? MR
 WALL: That's right
 So the -- the Petitioners here, Petitioner Barber, for instance, has 
been incarcerated for over  years
 At the end of each of his  years in prison, he has gotten  days of 
credit
 What Petitioner Barber is here saying is, I am going to get  whole years knocked off the end of my 
sentence; I want the  days for those years, too
 I want  days for every year of my sentence as imposed by the court, not as served by me behind 
bars, and that's what doesn't track the language of the 
statute
 Because the only way you can do that, as Justice Alito pointed out, is to read "year" to mean 
 days, and it is no answer to say, as Petitioners do, 
well, you can do the determination whenever
 What they are saying is at the end of a -day period, you should 
determine whether the prisoner gets the credit
 But what the statute says is the determination itself has to occur at the end of the 
year
 So you can't fold the  days into the year because you haven't made the determination yet
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I didn't understand them to be saying that
 I understood them to be saying  
 that the determination could be made at the end of 
 days, but if it's determined that the prisoner is 
entitled to  days of credit, then year  should be 
regarded as having begun on the th day, rather than 
the th day
 MR
 WALL: I think that's right, which first it is inconsistent with the language of the statute, 
which says at the end of each year, so that reads "year" 
to be an -day cycle
 But it also sets up a very odd system
 What happens if the prisoner misbehaves during days  and day ? On Petitioner's approach, it seems to me, the new year has started on day 
 Now, but take the example, he says, well, you can do it on the th day
 
Well, if the prisoner's misbehaved on day , is that 
coming out of the first year or out of the second year
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I think that they would say you won't know when the second year has begun 
until the full calendar year has been completed
 MR
 WALL: And I guess the -- the difficulty with that approach is that it seems to me that once the 
-day cycle is finished, you have to start a new 
-day cycle on day 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, they are just not vested until the year has -- the full year has passed
  
 MR
 WALL: Well, so vesting is a little bit unique, Justice Kennedy, under the statute, because none 
of the time vests under (b)() until they are actually 
released
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I use it just in the calculating sense
 MR
 WALL: I see -- I see what you're saying
 They could do the bookkeeping determination on day 
 But I don't think that's what's important
 What is important is that on Petitioner's view, the 
second year, for credit purposes, has to start on day 
 You have to have  blocks of  days and you have to be measuring after every th day
 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, you don't measure -- I don't think that -- you -- you begin 
measuring on , but you measure  days from -- from 
 And if he has behaved well during all -- all of those  days, then you knock off another  days or 
whatever it is
 And you begin the third year from then, but you give him another  days to determine whether 
he has behaved well
 MR
 WALL: Justice Scalia, if you are JUSTICE SCALIA: Right
 MR
 WALL: -- then you should equally be 
 measuring  days from day 
 Which is to say, if JUSTICE SCALIA: He did
 He did
 You didn't give him the credit until he served the whole 
 days
 At that point, he gets the credit and you count the second year as though it begins on day 
 MR
 WALL: Well, the -- I was half with you there
 The bureau does do it by looking at what they do during the full year, from January  to 
December , and then it determines whether you get 
 days knocked off the end of your sentence
 What happens between day  and day  is not different 
than what happens during the rest of the year
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly
 MR
 WALL: What the -- what the statute asks the bureau to determine is, at the end of each year, 
has, during that year, the prisoner demonstrated 
exemplary compliance with institutional regulations? So the prisoner has got to go a full year, a full  days, 
and be well-behaved
 Then he gets  days taken off the back end of the sentence
 And if that's the way that you're saying it should work, that is precisely how the 
bureau interprets the statute
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that they're not  
 taking it off from the back end
 They are taking it off from the next year
 So that in the second year, if he -- if he behaves well for  days from  -- okay? He behaves well for the next  days
 The next year will begin at 
 But then he has to serve another  days before he gets good time credit
 And then the next year will begin three times : 
 And so forth
 MR
 WALL: Justice Alito, I think that sets up an odd system
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that right? See, he agrees with me
 (Laughter
) No, I'm not saying that's right
 I'm saying that that's -- that is what he is proposing
 MR
 WALL: No, I -- I agree
 That is the difference
 Petitioners think that you measure credit over these -day cycles, and if you -- you know, you 
get to the th day, you take the  days of credit, 
and together, they equal a year of the sentence imposed
 But what the statute says is you make the determination at the end of the year
 And we don't read "year" to be a -day period
 We read it to be a -day period
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but as Justice Scalia  
 says, you know, you do make the determination on the 
th day, but what you determine is that the -- having 
been a good prisoner, his first year expired  days 
earlier, and then you start over
 MR
 WALL: But what -- that's right
 But what the statute -- the statute doesn't just say, 
Justice Stevens, you make the determination at the end 
of the first year of the term
 The determination is that during that year, the prisoner has displayed 
compliance
 So he has got to display compliance through day  through day 
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me interrupt and get one thing off my mind that I just -- supposing he 
misbehaves in year 
 Does that just affect his good time credits in year , or does it mean he is canceled 
for years  and ? MR
 WALL: No
 He can lose credit that he has accrued up to that point, but he can't lose credit 
that he has -- that he is eligible for in future years
 
So let's say that we are coming up on the end of the rd 
year
 He's earned his full  days for his first two years, and he has earned some prorated portion
 He can lose any of that, but he is still eligible going forward 
to keep getting  days at the end of each year
 JUSTICE STEVENS: But he can lose his  
  days? MR
 WALL: Yes
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can he do that? I'm looking at page A of your appendix
 It says: Such credit toward service of sentence vests at the time 
that it is received
 Credit that is vested may not later be withdrawn
 MR
 WALL: I'm sorry, Mr
 Chief Justice
 I should have been more clear
 For prisoners sentenced subject to the SRA, which was in effect from  to , you are right
 
And that is the SRA according to your brief
 Their credit vests
 That vesting requirement was eliminated in the PLRA, which governs 
prisoner's sentences since 
 So for the vast bulk of prisoners in the Federal system who are subject to 
the PLRA, their credit does not vest until they are 
released
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Wall, the -- if we consider both methods plausible, the number comes out at 
 percent --  percent,  percent
 It's a more workable number, and there are some hints in the 
legislative history that Congress thought  percent, 
not 
 or whatever it is
 So in choosing between those two methods,  
 why not take the easier number to work with? MR
 WALL: Well, two reasons
 I think to the extent that you are suggesting the statute is 
ambiguous, the Bureau of Prisons is charged by Congress 
with administering the statute in both Reno v
 Koray and 
Lopez v
 Davis
 This Court deferred to the bureau's interpretation of other prisoner credit statutes
 We think the bureau is equally entitled to the same 
discretion here to interpret this statute
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We -- if we disagree with that, if we disagree that the BOP has authority in this 
area, then -- as Justice Ginsburg's question, I think, 
suggests -- does not the Rule of Lenity apply? MR
 WALL: and I -- I can't put it any better than Justice 
Sotomayor did in her first opinion in Sash -- that this 
is not a criminal statute
 It neither imposes a JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how do you explain the Granderson case? MR
 WALL: I'm sorry? JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Granderson case
 MR
 WALL: I'm not familiar with that case, Justice Kennedy
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I had thought that in that  
 case, Justice Ginsburg, for this Court, established the 
proposition that the Rule of Lenity is applicable
 I know it wasn't cited in the Petitioner's brief, either
 
That was a parole revocation case
 But in -- in any event, the -- shouldn't the Rule of Lenity apply? If the Rule of Lenity is thought of as a notice requirement insofar as giving you warning 
to what conduct is punishable, that's one thing, but 
doesn't the Rule of Lenity mean more than that? It's a check against the power of the State, so that you simply 
mitigate the -- the power of the State in favor of the 
individual
 In a case like this, apply the Rule of Lenity
 MR
 WALL: I think it's a check against the power of the State when it's penalizing conduct or when 
it's putting forth a penalty for a criminal prohibition
 
But in both Koray and Lopez, this Court was considering 
what prisoner credit statutes meant, other prisoner 
credit statutes
  U
S
C
  and 
 And in both of those, it deferred to the bureau's interpretation
 
And in both, it specifically rejected application of the 
Rule of Lenity
 And I think the notion there is that this statute is not a criminal statute
 It's about an administrative reward for compliance with institutional  
 regulations
 And that's different from setting forth a prohibition on conduct where the penalty that someone is 
sentenced to by a court once they have been convicted of 
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the Granderson case is cited in the brief for the National Association Of 
Criminal Defense Lawyers, and as I read it, it applies 
to this area and it seems to me that it ought to
 I mean, you tell us this is not a criminal statute
 I -- I certainly think it has -- it has all the impact and force of the State detaining a person for 
a criminal act
 MR
 WALL: Well, it is a statute that determines in some sense how long you will be in prison, 
so I take your point
 But it does so not by extending the penalty applicable to the conduct, but by offering 
an administrative reward; sort of relieving you of part 
of the burden of that -- that penalty
 And I am not aware of any case -- and I am obviously not familiar with Granderson, but I am not 
aware of any case from this Court, or indeed any lower 
court, finding that section  is a criminal statute, 
as this Court's cases uses the term
 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but isn't there another consideration? It's not the Rule of Lenity, but  
 it's something else we should take into account
 In the -- in their reply brief, they say it costs about  or $, to house a particular 

something like $ million in taxpayers' money is at 
issue in this case
 It -- is -- you don't disagree with that general figure, do you? MR
 WALL: I'm -- I think the basis for that is just math that the Petitioners have done
 I don't have any independent basis for confirming or denying it
 JUSTICE STEVENS: But in any event, it's clear it's a lot of money
 And -- and is that not a factor that we should be aware of in this case, because, 
all other things being equal -- assume the statute is 
totally ambiguous, and if you -- if one -- one -- one 
version will save the -- the government $ million a 

isn't that a factor we -- we should take into 
consideration? MR
 WALL: I think it's a factor that the bureau could, should and has taken into consideration in 
the developing its interpretation as the agency in 
charge of administering the statute
 But what the bureau has found is that it's method allows you to earn 
good time for all the time you are incarcerated, so you  
 always have incentive to follow prison regulations
 And what Petitioners haven't responded to and the government's point in our brief that if you 
start measuring by -day cycles, you are assuming that 
they getting the full  days of credit
 And to the extent that they don't, no matter how they calculate it, 
Justice Scalia, no matter what their matter of 
bookkeeping is, if they don't get the  days of credit 
for each cycle, there will be some corresponding period 
at the end of the sentence when they are serving time 
and they have already had their ten -- you know, their 
JUSTICE BREYER: That's true
 But the strongest argument -- I -- I don't want to put words in 
his mouth because this is complicated
 But I see it as this
 Let's call that time you are talking about, that tenth year, phantom time
 MR
 WALL: Okay
 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, you are saying don't put in any phantom time
 And he's saying let's put some in
 Now, the strong -- a strong argument, I think, for his is the following -- think about that 
first year
 That first year we are going to calculate  days, subtract it, everybody seems to agree we get to  
 the number , right? But if you were to apply the last sentence to that first year, the prorating sentence, you wouldn't 
get 
 You would get like  days, or  or something like that
 But everybody agrees under the Bureau of Prisons system that it is 
 And, therefore, in respect to the first year, they are calculating phantom 
time, i
e
, not the first year, but a person who had a 
sentence to a year and a day
 If you had a sentence to a year and a day, you agree it's  days, and everybody 
agrees with that, and that includes phantom time
 So he said, well, if you include it for the first year, since the statute says nothing about the 
first year, why not include it for the other years, too? 
How can you possibly justify phantom time being included 
in the first year but not in the other years? MR
 WALL: Justice Breyer, I disagree with your premise
 Someone sentenced to a year and a day is eligible for credit, but because that person is accruing 
credit as he serves, he will never actually get  days
 
By the time he gets to the th day, he has accrued 
 days of credit, those combine to equal his -day 
sentence
 JUSTICE BREYER: So, in other words, they don't let him out under ?  
 MR
 WALL: JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, the Bureau of Prisons for a person whose has a sentence of a year 
and a day does not let him out  days short, rather 
they let him out  days short, because they apply the 
last sentence in the prorating of that sentence? MR
 WALL: And that's exactly our difference with Petitioner's view
 Exactly
 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that -- is that what happens? MR
 WALL: Yes
 Yes
 He is released after the th day
 And I think what Petitioners actually want is phantom time even in the first year
 What they are saying is fine, he may only serve  days,  days, 
 days, we want the full 
 So, instead of letting him out at , back him up to , we want the phantom 
week in the first year
 And, so, I think the way the bureau interprets it, there is no phantom time in any year
 
The way the Petitioners interpret it, there is phantom 
time in every year, no matter the length of the 
sentence
 As I said I think it creates a gap in coverage
 It rests on this assumption that prisoners are always getting  days
 That is just not the case
 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you disagree with your colleague that that is the case most of the time, that 
most Federal prisoners get good time credit, and of the 
ones who get credit, most of them get the full  days? MR
 WALL: There are no statistics on this, but, yes, Justice Ginsburg, I think the majority of 
prisoners do earn the full credit, certainly these 
Petitioners have
 But I would say that there are, say,  to  percent Federal prisoner who tend to be repeat 
offenders, and they are often being docked to good time 
credit
 So, I think what you will see is that the ones getting  days do it consistently, and the ones 
not getting  days, often do that pretty consistently
 
And, you know, the difficulty on Petitioner's method is 
that no matter when you want to do that calculation, 
Petitioners at bottom are saying what you should be 
looking at is a -day period, and you take the 
 days served, you take the  days of credit, and 
together they give you a year of the sentence imposed
 And not only does that not serve penological interest, as the bureau has found, but it just doesn't 
track the language of the statute, which says during 
each year you have got to comply with the regulations
 
The statute cares not just about your conduct from days 
  to , but your conduct from day  to 
 All of those days are equal in the statute's eyes
 If you want  days of credit knocked off the back end of your 
sentence, you have got to behave and comply with the 
rules for a full year each time you want the credit
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, this explanation that has been given in your brief and the 
one you are giving to us now as to why BOP chose what it 
did, is there any statement outside of the penned 
affidavit that explains why this choice was made? MR
 WALL: positions that the bureau has taken before the  courts 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But in each one of them they have taken the position that the statute was 
unambiguous
 Assuming that that is not accepted by us, that it's ambiguous, what and where are we giving 
Chevron or Skidmore deference to what set of facts or to 
MR
 WALL: Two points, Justice Sotomayor
 I don't think the bureau has always taken the position 
that the statute is unambiguous
 It has taken the fallback position, and it has prevailed on this position 
in a number of courts of appeals
 And it is worth pointing out the bureau has prevailed in the First  
 through the Eleventh Circuits
 It has won in  court of appeals
 And it has often prevailed on the ground that it had discretion to interpret the statute to the 
extended it was ambiguous
 Your second point, what would you defer JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, did they exercise discretion when they took the position that it was 
unambiguous? MR
 WALL: As the pen declaration makes clear, and this is at page  of the Joint Appendix, 
when the bureau promulgated its rule in , it did 
that based on the statutory language and on making a 
policy choice to accommodate penological interest, 
ensuring that credit would always be an incentive to 
good behavior and providing clear notice to inmates of 
their projected release dates
 So, I think -- you know, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We have never given deference, have we, to an affidavit submitted in 
litigation to explain something that on its face is not 
explained either in an agency's regulation or in its 
policy statement that -- that -- this is giving 
deference to an affidavit
 MR
 WALL: Well, it's giving deference to  
 the rule, because the affidavit informs the court that 
the rule is an exercise of the bureau's discretion
 So far as I know, the court has never faced that question 
but the lower courts have
 And a number of courts of appeals faced with rulemaking and informal adjudication 
have accepted supplementation of the record with 
affidavits and declarations very much like this one
 
Because what we are talking about here is an affidavit 
from one of the agency's original decisionmakers
 If this was just a post hyperactualization, I grant you it might not be enough
 But this is one of the bureau's lawyers involved in the decisionmaking in 
the mid-'s coming in and saying, here is why we 
JUSTICE SCALIA: Subsequent legislative history, so to speak, right? (Laughter
) JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, we -- we wouldn't allow that -- those of us who use legislative history 
don't allow a congressman to come in several years after 
the bill has passed and say, oh, by the way, the reason 
we voted for that is thus and such
 We would kick that out
 Why is it any different for an agency's subsequent statement?  
 MR
 WALL: Justice Scalia, I think it is different because that would be broadside in Overton 
Park
 And what this Court said is if there is not enough in the agency action itself to enable judicial 
review, the right answer is not to set it aside, the 
right answer is to send it back to the agency to let the 
agency decision makers explain why they did what they 
did
 And while that might normally be the right course here, the agency has already done that
 It has put forward its explanation, so I think this is one of 
the rare circumstances where we don't need to remand on 
Overton Park
 We know why the agency adopted the rule, and it did it both because of the statutory language and 
because they thought it was the most sensible policy 
choice
 And I guess I would turn it around a little bit and say you have a rule promulgated by the agency 
charged with administering the statute, an agency to 
which this Court has twice deferred in the 
interpretation of similar statutes
 That rule has been upheld as a substantive matter now in  courts of 
appeals
 The Ninth Circuit set the rule aside on a procedural basis, which has now been corrected by the 
 agency
 It's a republished rule which corrects the infirmities that the court of appeals identified
 And, so, the question is, faced with those facts, what would be the point of asking the government 
to recalculate , Federal sentences? JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think we sent cases back under Overton Park for an agency's description of 
history
 I think we sent it back for the agency to give a reason for its rule, whether that's its current reason 
or its past reason
 It -- it's the current reason that counts
 MR
 WALL: Justice Scalia, even -- even if you thought as the court of appeals did that the rule 
was procedurally invalid, you would still, as the court 
of appeals did, defer to the program statement under 
some level of deference, at least Skidmore
 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have to worry about me
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm -- I'm willing to accept the -- the government's assertion here that 
that's the government's position
 MR
 WALL: JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think you are lying
  
 MR
 WALL: (Laughter
) MR
 WALL: My only point, Justice Scalia, was that whether you get there by deferring to the rule 
or by deferring to the program statement, as the court 
of appeals did, every court of appeals to consider it 
has come out in the same place, which is that by hook or 
by crook, the bureau has exercised its discretion to 
answer this question
 JUSTICE STEVENS: You say there are , sentences affected by this rule
 I don't know which way that cuts
 If there are , people spending more time in -- you know, significantly more time in jail 
than they should, that's kind of troublesome
 MR
 WALL: Justice Stevens, I think what I would say is the bureau has been doing it the same way 
since 
 Congress has amended this statute five times in the last  years
 It has never moved to alter the bureau's methods
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: JUSTICE STEVENS: Probably they didn't understand it because it's an awfully hard statute to 
understand
 MR
 WALL: Justice Stevens, with all respect, Justice Breyer got it in the first  minutes
 
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, he's a lot smarter than I am
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even Justice Breyer has got it! Whoa! (Laughter
) JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what -- what we were -- what we were saying, is this is , years of 
prisoner time, I mean -- ,, that is older than 
Marbury versus Madison
 MR
 WALL: Justice Kennedy, that's true
 I think the point is that the language of the statute has 
remained unchanged, and for the last  years the bureau 
has interpreted that in a reasonable way
 The language is unambiguous, but even if it weren't, at least the 
bureau's interpretation is reasonable, which is why  
courts of appeals have deferred to it
 And so I take your point that they are serving more time than under Petitioner's 
interpretation, but I don't think that that policy 
rationale is properly before this Court
 It is properly before the bureau, which has found that policy 
consideration outweighed by other penological interests, 
and I think that's the judgment to which this Court  
 should defer, not its own judgment about how much time 
these prisoners should -- should be serving
 And I do think it's important in that regard that Congress has returned the statute several times
 
And I take your point that it is complicated, Justice 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish MR
 WALL: -- but Congress has made a number of technical amendments and I don't think there is any 
evidence it did not understand of how this longstanding 
system works
 Thank you
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr
 Wall
 Mr
 Sady, you have  minutes remaining
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R
 SADY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS MR
 SADY: Thank you
 The -- the idea that there could be time at the end of the sentences is premised on "term of 
imprisonment" mean "time served," which it cannot mean 
in the same sentence where it says "beyond time served
" If you make the adjustment for good time credit that is earned at the end of the year, it is 
credit towards the service of the sentence; that means  
 that it's blocks of  days, that at the last day of 
Mr
 Barber's sentence if it's properly computed, he 
would be looking at  days
 If he behaved well until close to the end, if we go to the last statute that says 

remaining  days he could earn, and credit it in the 
last  weeks, because they are doing that simply as an 
administrative technique
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just so -- in your system they do the measurement at the end of the 
 days
 He misbehaves on the th day
 And they say for that reason, I'm only going to give you  days of 
full time -- of good time credit
 MR
 SADY: Yes
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now your year starts at ? MR
 SADY: 
 Yes
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, they said they are only giving you  days of good time credit
 Because at the end of -- 
 MR
 SADY: Right
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That was pretty bad
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
 Now, your year  
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They don't say: Now, I agree you can use my name for fundraising purposes
 But that's -- it's implicit, you say, in their signing the 
petition that the --MR
 BOPP: Well, what --JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- signature collector can sell the names, use them for its own fundraising 
purposes? MR
 BOPP: What is implicit is they are associating with this group for a purpose, and that is 
support for, in this case, Referendum 
 And so they use those names for valid purposes
 But --JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr
 Bopp, do you have any case in which we have held that the First Amendment 
applies to activity that consists of the process of 
legislation, of legislating --MR
 BOPP: Yes, Buckley II
 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- or of adopting legislation? What is that? MR
 BOPP: Buckley II
 You struck down the requirement that the person who is soliciting signatures 
self-identify
 JUSTICE SCALIA: That is --MR
 BOPP: That is a process --JUSTICE SCALIA: Soliciting signatures is not 
 taking part in the process of legislating
 MR
 BOPP: Well --JUSTICE SCALIA: The person who requests a referendum is taking -- when there's a certain number of 
signatures required to achieve it, is taking part in 
that
 And in light of the fact that for the first century of our existence, even voting was public -- you 
either did it raising your hand or by voice, or later, 
you had a ballot that was very visibly red or blue so 
that people knew which party you were voting for -- the 
fact is that running a democracy takes a certain amount 
of civic courage
 And the First Amendment does not protect you from criticism or even nasty phone calls 
when you exercise your political rights to legislate or 
to take part in the legislative process
 MR
 BOPP: Well, the --JUSTICE SCALIA: You are asking us to enter into a whole new field where we™ve never gone before
 MR
 BOPP: Well, with all due respect, you have already opined in Buckley II that the person on the 
other side of the clipboard is protected by the First 
Amendment
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't think that's --that's true of Buckley II
 What was -- what this Court  
 said could not be done is that the solicitor could not 
be made to wear a badge that says "I am a paid 
solicitor," but that the solicitor's name had to be 
identified for the State
 Certainly, the solicitor --there was an affidavit, and there was the filings with 
whatever was the State agency
 So what was -- what this Court said could not be done was this kind of in-your-face big button 
that says "I am a paid solicitor," but the solicitor's 
name and address certainly had to be disclosed
 MR
 BOPP: That is true
 You've correctly described Buckley II
 But as we can see in the facts of this case, the public disclosure of the petition names 
in this case -- there was a planned harassment and 
intimidation of these voters by --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me -- let me ask you, could the opponents of a particular ballot measure 
organize a boycott for -- and picket businesses whose 
managers had supported that boycott? MR
 BOPP: Yes
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Had supported that initiative? MR
 BOPP: Yes
 Under the --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if that's so, then under Claiborne Hardware, which I -- I notice you  
 didn't cite in your brief, but if -- if that's so, 
then it seems to me that the State's -- or 
that -- that the signers' interest in keeping their 
names private is somewhat diminished
 MR
 BOPP: Yes
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a First Amendment activity
 MR
 BOPP: But what we're -- but what is involved here that is not involved there is the 
requirement by the government that you publicly disclose 
your identity and beliefs on a matter that then --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- just --MR
 BOPP -- subjects you to the boycott
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let me stop you there, because I think your -- your own brief, I think you said 
twice that you cannot tell anything about the signer's 
belief from the mere signature
 You said it could be support for -- for the proposition or it could be just 
support for letting the people decide
 MR
 BOPP: That is --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Or it could even be, you say, that this solicitor is pesky, and in order to 
placate the solicitor, to get rid of the solicitor, we™ll 
just sign
 So you -- you have said that -- that the signing itself is ambiguous
 You don't know what  
 the reason is
 It doesn't necessarily mean that the person is a supporter of the proposition
 MR
 BOPP: But, with all due respect, we did not say the third
 We did say the first and the second
 And -- but either of those are political statements
 The highlighted box at the top, you know, states -- states that by signing R-, we can reverse that 
decision, meaning the passage of a law, and protect 
marriage between a man and a woman
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I call your attention to page  of your reply brief? Because I don't think that your response was correct
 You say: Do petition signers support the repeal, simply indicate they would 
like public election to be held, or simply sign to avoid 
any further discussion with the petition circulator? MR
 BOPP: I acknowledge that we said that, Justice Ginsburg
 And, of course, the second statement is -- and which I think is the dominant statement and 
certainly sufficient -- and that is that we want a measure 
to be placed on the ballot in order for the people to 
vote
 That is one of the central --JUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr
 Bopp, if a voter --if the legislature passes a statute and someone is -- is 
satisfied with that statute, how likely is it that that 
person is going to sign a petition to have a referendum  
 to see whether the statute should be blocked? MR
 BOPP: I think it's very unlikely
 But it -- we acknowledge it's possible, but we think it's 
very unlikely
 JUSTICE ALITO: It's possible --JUSTICE KENNEDY: But --JUSTICE ALITO: -- but if you were in the real world, if you were to poll the people who sign a 
referendum petition with respect to a statute that was 
passed by the State legislature, what percentage do you 
think would be opposed to that legislation? MR
 BOPP: Very few
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so Justice Alito's question points out that this would be a very slim basis 
upon which to rest a holding in your favor
 And just to go back to the line of questions of the first, the State of California has very 
complicated referendum and initiative matters
 Don't you think it's relevant for the public to know that, 
say, a public employees union had paid solicitors to put 
those signatures on the ballot, or that the Chamber of 
Commerce or the National Association of Manufacturers had 
paid solicitors to put this on the ballot? Isn't that part of assessing the -- the reasons why this initiative was proposed? And isn't  
 that vital to the voters -- to the voter in making an 
informed decision? MR
 BOPP: Well, actually, after your Buckley II decision, the Ninth Circuit struck down the 
requirement of disclosing the paid circulators
 And, of course, in California, petitions are not public
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They did that
 It wasn't due to Buckley II, because as you just acknowledged, 
under Buckley II, the solicitor is disclosed
 MR
 BOPP: Well, the Ninth Circuit thought it was Buckley
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Correct me, but the point is, isn't -- isn™t there an interest in knowing this 
information? Not -- not that it's paid
 MR
 BOPP: There is no evidence --JUSTICE KENNEDY: We'll leave that out
 But -- but to know that -- that -- the persons that 
supported the amendment
 MR
 BOPP: There™s no evidence in the record that that is pertinent information, and, at most, 
we think it is marginal information
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, if we create this right of -- this constitutional right of 
association in the manner that you are describing it, 
why is it limited to the voting area?  
 Would we be inviting review if a group of citizens get together and send a letter to an agency 
that says please pass X regulation, or rescind Y 
regulation? Would the agency be prohibited from making that letter public? MR
 BOPP: Well, potentially
 And -- and this Court -- I -- because it would be required to be 
subject to a First Amendment analysis
 It's this Court that created, in the NAACP case --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're -- you're suggesting --MR
 BOPP: -- the right of private association
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that when a petitioner or a person engages in political discourse 
with the government, that they -- when they choose to do 
it, because the government is not compelling them to 
write to it; it™s not compelling them to sign the 
referendum
 It's just --MR
 BOPP: And they™re not compelling Ms
 McIntyre to distribute her brochure, either
 But this Court held that --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's -- but Ms
 McIntyre wasn't asking the government to engage its 
process in her favor
 She was asking for political 
 reform, but she wasn't asking to engage the government 
process on her behalf
 MR
 BOPP: Well, the government, you know, has a lot of options
 For instance, they don't have to conduct elections for the election of judge
 But if they opt to do that and provide that procedure, well, 
then, the First Amendment applies to the political 
speech
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, to follow up on Justice Sotomayor's question, do you think an agency 
could say, if you want to comment on proposed -- on a 
proposed rule, you have to disclose to us your name and 
your address and your telephone number and your 
political affiliation, and all sorts of -- your marital 
status and your income level and all sorts of other 
demographic information? MR
 BOPP: And your employer, as in this case here
 JUSTICE ALITO: Could they do that? MR
 BOPP: No -- no, because there is no sufficient governmental interest that would justify it
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not even just your name, so they can check that this thing isn't phony and that all 
the names on it aren't -- aren't made up by one person? MR
 BOPP: They, of course, can -- can check  
 that
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, they can
 So they can get your name, right? MR
 BOPP: Yes, they can get your name --JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay
 MR
 BOPP: -- and we™re not objecting to filing of a petition
 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you™re objecting to the public being able to check whether the agency is 
indeed finding out whether this is a genuine petition or 
not, correct? MR
 BOPP: No
 No, I'm not objecting to that
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Really? MR
 BOPP: They have procedures to check and verify these signatures that do not involve public 
disclosure
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't you have some options, too? Have you started a referendum to repeal the -- the California law that requires disclosure? MR
 BOPP: California law does not require disclosure of the petitions, and that has been upheld by 
the courts of California
 And you can verify these signatures
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand
 I  
 thought that™s what you™re challenging
 The --MR
 BOPP: Well, but you asked about California --JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry
 I'm sorry
 MR
 BOPP: -- if I heard your question
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Washington
 I got the wrong State
 MR
 BOPP: Okay
 It --JUSTICE BREYER: Can you go back --JUSTICE SCALIA: The people of Washington -- the people Washington evidently think that this is not too much of an imposition upon people's courage, to -- to stand up and sign something and be 
willing to stand behind it
 MR
 BOPP: In a sense --JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, if you don't like that, I can see doing it another way
 But -- but the people of Washington have chosen to do it this -- this 
way
 MR
 BOPP: Actually, for --JUSTICE SCALIA: And you™re saying that the First Amendment absolutely forbids that
 MR
 BOPP: Actually, for a century, they chose not to do this
 It wasn't until  --JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine
 Proving my point
  
 MR
 BOPP: They did not publicly disclose the petitions for a century
 JUSTICE SCALIA: It might have been a good idea
 MR
 BOPP: Well --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose the -- a majority of the voters in Washington decided that, and 
one of the purposes of the First Amendment is to protect 
minorities
 MR
 BOPP: Well, only in the most general sense
 They adopted a Public Records Act
 They didn't adopt a law that specifically required the disclosure of 
these petitions
 But in a general sense, they did
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr
 Bopp, this is not a peculiar thing to the State of Washington; that's 
correct, isn't it? Aren't there about -odd States that require disclosure of the names of signers to 
initiatives, referenda? MR
 BOPP: That is true
 Some -- some in their initiative and referendum statute, because they 
actually provide some public input on verification where 
Washington does not; others under their Public Records 
Act
 Some do not, such as California
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- but what you™re saying with respect to Washington would go for most of 
 those other States that have -- that have public 
disclosure of initiative and referendum petitions
 MR
 BOPP: Well, one -- one thing we say is different between Washington and these other States is 
that Washington provides no way for the public, even if 
they get access to the petitions, to participate in the 
verification process
 The only thing the public can do is have --observe -- a limited number of observers
 These observers are prohibited from --JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that there were instances where the State official missed something and 
a member of the public who had access to the list of 
signers said: Wait a minute; I know so-and-so was my neighbor who died  years ago
 MR
 BOPP: That's not allowed in the State of Washington
 The instructions from the Secretary of State is while you can have observers to observe the 
process, the people --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you mean if -- that was over
 It passed the screen of the Secretary of State
 It's disclosed to the public
 If someone then said you've got a lot of dead souls on these lists, the State 
would do nothing about it? MR
 BOPP: There is absolutely no procedure  
 under Washington statute to do anything with that 
information
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we™ll ask --we™ll ask the --MR
 BOPP: Nothing
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We™ll ask the Attorney General of Washington
 MR
 BOPP: Yes
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Weren™t two of the Petitioners here -- weren't two of the Petitioners here 
seeking the list so that they could go over the 
certification process the State had done to ensure that 
they had certified all the right people, et cetera? MR
 BOPP: Well, one of -- one of the intervenors sought an exception from the -- from the 
injunction, which we did not object to, that -- that 
they would have access to the list
 But under confidentiality and protective order --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not going to the privacy questions
 You responded to Justice Ginsburg by saying that there was no way to challenge the State's 
process of validation, and that -- I don't think that's 
correct
 MR
 BOPP: With all respect, I didn't say that
  
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh
 MR
 BOPP: What I -- what I said is there™s no role for the public in verifying signatures
 You can ask for judicial review --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's assuming the answer, meaning if they don't have the right to access, 
they can't
 But, legally, they can challenge it if they find on the petitions that things were erroneously 
counted by the State
 They can go into court and prove that
 MR
 BOPP: The only thing that they could do is request that the court does its own count
 In other words, there's judicial review available
 But the public has no role in the verification, but they can 
trigger judicial review
 And then the court conducts its own count
 In other words, this is not an adversary process in which people come in and present evidence 
of -- of people's -- of invalid signatures
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would you involve the court? If the State's -- the executive representative of the State says: Oh, we missed that
 Now we're going to have to deal with it
 We don't need any court to order us to do it
 MR
 BOPP: Well, the observers can observe 
 the process, and if they feel --JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, this is after the observers
 This is --MR
 BOPP: Well, but --JUSTICE GINSBURG: We™re talking about a member of the public noticing that there are people on the list who shouldn't be there
 MR
 BOPP: Well, the -- the observer --under the Washington procedure, observers can observe 
the process, and if they feel, or if anyone feels, that there has been an inadequate job in -- in verification, then they can ask for judicial review
 
And then the court conducts the --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would they ask for judicial review instead of going first to the State's 
Attorney General and saying, look, you -- your people 
missed it? MR
 BOPP: Well, there's no procedure for that
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why involve the court? MR
 BOPP: That's not -- there™s no procedure for that
 You know, if they wanted to involve the public -- and that's the difference, I said, between 
this procedure and other procedures
 They™re claiming the need for public disclosure so the public can be  
 involved in verification
 Well, there™s no procedure --JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't there another --MR
 BOPP: -- to be involved in verification
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't there another possible public interest? Would it be a legitimate public interest to say I™d like to know who signed the 
petition because I would like to try to persuade them 
that their views should be modified? Is there a public interest in encouraging debate on the underlying issue? MR
 BOPP: Well, it's possible, but we think this information is marginal
 In other words, the --it's much more important --JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it does identify people who have a -- a particular point of view on a 
public issue
 And if you had the other point of view, don't you have an interest in finding out who you™d 
like to convince to change their minds? MR
 BOPP: Well, we -- we think it's a -- a very marginal interest
 The Ninth Circuit recently ruled that if you give a small contribution to an 
initiative, there's not -- I mean, nobody cares
 So why should it be publicly disclosed when it's so marginal? JUSTICE SCALIA: What about just -- just -- 
 what about just wanting to know their names so you can criticize them? (Laughter
) MR
 BOPP: Well --JUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is that such a bad thing in a democracy? MR
 BOPP: Well, what is bad is not the criticism; it's the public -- it's the government 
requiring you to disclose your identity and beliefs
 JUSTICE SCALIA: But part of the reason is so you can be out there and be responsible for the 
positions you™ve taken
 MR
 BOPP: Well, then why don't they require both sides? JUSTICE SCALIA: So that people -- people can criticize you for the position you have taken
 MR
 BOPP: Then why don't they require both sides if that was the purpose? JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean, "both sides"? The other side hasn't signed anything
 When they sign something --(Laughter
) MR
 BOPP: Well, but the other side --JUSTICE SCALIA: When they sign something, they™ll be out there for public criticism as well
  
 MR
 BOPP: Okay
 But this is a one-way street
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, this is such a touchy-feely, oh, so sensitive about -- about any --(Laughter
) JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, you can't run a democracy this way, with everybody being afraid of 
having his political positions known
 MR
 BOPP: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia, but the campaign manager of this initiative had his family 
sleep in his living room because of the threats --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then that™s --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's bad
 The threats should be moved against vigorously --MR
 BOPP: And -- and --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- but just because there can be criminal activity doesn't mean that you --
you have to eliminate a procedure that is 
otherwise perfectly reasonable
 MR
 BOPP: But all we™re asking for is a First Amendment analysis of the compelled disclosure of 
the identity of these people and whether or not these 
interests are sufficient
 Could I reserve the balance of my time? CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr
 Bopp
 
 General McKenna
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL ROBERT M
 McKENNA ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS MR
 McKENNA: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I™d like to begin with the question of how the public can bring to the attention of the 
government that errors and fraud have been discovered
 First of all, it's important to understand that the petitions do not become public records after 
the verification process but, in fact, are made available 
as public records before the verification process even 
begins
 This is because the Secretary of State's first step after receiving submitted petitions is to 
take them to his archiving section and to have them 
digitized
 As soon as they™re digitized, they™re available on disks for anyone who requests them
 Then the verification process begins
 During the verification process, it is possible --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How much time are we talking about in those processes? MR
 McKENNA: The verification process, Justice Sotomayor? 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes
 MR
 McKENNA: The verification process will depend on how many signatures have been 
submitted --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no
 I'm trying to get the relationship between the disks being made 
available and the verification process
 So is there a time for the public to look through the disks before the people who are sent into 
the room are sent into the room? JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what you™ve just said --MR
 McKENNA: Yes, they™re --JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that they're --that they are immediately available on the disk, and 
so while the checking is going on by the Secretary, 
the public has the list
 Is that what you™ve just said? MR
 McKENNA: Yes, that's correct
 For example, in the case of Referendum , the proponents of 
the referendum submitted the petition sheets on 
Saturday, July , , and on Tuesday, July , a 
records request was already submitted
 And so they can obtain records --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would these records --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was that pursuant to the Public Records Act that we™re talking about --MR
 McKENNA: Yes
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- or was that part of the initiative and referendum structure before the Public 
Records Act was passed? MR
 McKENNA: Justice Kennedy, this is part of the Public Records Act
 This is as a result of the Public Records Act that these petition sheets are 
made available
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --JUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- all right
 So this -- the public record -- pardon me
 The -- in California, we call it an initiative and referendum 
process -- existed and was in place before the Public 
Records Act added this additional feature of disclosure? MR
 McKENNA: Yes, that's correct
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So there was a judgment at one time by the State of Washington that it didn't --
that it didn't need the public records disclosure? MR
 McKENNA: Well, when the initiative and referendum processes were created by public vote on 
a constitutional amendment of , there was no 
Public Records Act at all
 And the Public Records Act, an Act of general applicability, was adopted by the 
 voters in  as part of an initiative which also 
enacted comprehensive campaign finance reform
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if the State had a law that you could disclose voters and for 
whom they voted, would that implicate First Amendment 
interests? MR
 McKENNA: Yes, Mr
 Chief Justice, we would -- we do believe that First Amendment interests 
would be implicated by revealing how people voted, and 
we don't see a legitimate State interest in knowing how 
people voted, only in who voted
 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the country was acting unconstitutionally for a whole century before we adopted 
the Australian secret ballot? Do you really think that? MR
 McKENNA: No
 No, Justice Scalia
 I --JUSTICE SCALIA: That it was unconstitutional --MR
 McKENNA: No, Justice Scalia
 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- for a whole century not to have a secret ballot? MR
 McKENNA: No, Justice Scalia, I didn't say that I thought that the secret ballot was 
constitutionally required
 I was asked by the Chief Justice whether some First Amendment interests would be 
implicated
 They probably would be
  
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What would the First Amendment interests be? MR
 McKENNA: Well, the First Amendment interest in how you vote? CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes
 MR
 McKENNA: You know, it might be implicated by a potential chill from voting, if you know 
your vote is going to be revealed
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think having your name revealed on a petition of this sort might have 
a chilling effect on whether you sign it? MR
 McKENNA: Mr
 Chief Justice, some chill may result, just as some chill may result from 
having your campaign contributions disclosed or the 
fact that you have registered to vote and provided your 
name, address, your voting history is being disclosed
 
So some chill might be -- might result, but we do not 
think that it is significant enough
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't think revealing that you™re a voter has the same chilling 
effect as revealing how you voted, do you? MR
 McKENNA: No, I do not
 I think how you voted would have a much greater chilling effect than 
the fact that you are registered to vote
 And -- and, of course, this Court has not 
 ruled on whether the secret ballot is, you know, a 
constitutional right
 If -- if it is, then is town hall voting in New England unconstitutional? Is the caucus system in Iowa for presidential candidates 
unconstitutional? The Court in this case does not have --JUSTICE ALITO: -- in the last questions --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought you told me that the First Amendment interests were implicated 
with respect to the secret ballot, that you couldn't 
require people to reveal how they voted
 MR
 McKENNA: We don't -- we don't know if this Court would rule that the vote could never be 
revealed
 We know that in some places, votes are done in public
 We know that before the late s, there was no secret ballot
 We just -- we don't know what the constitutional ruling would be
 But we -- we do know that in this case, it's not necessary for the Court to 
reach that -- that determination, because in this 
case --JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I™d like to know how far you -- you are -- you want to go
 You say in your brief that the availability of the referendum 
signature petitions allows Washington voters to engage 
in discussion of referred measures with persons whose  
 acts secured the election and suspension of State law
 So would -- would it be consistent with the First Amendment to require anybody who signs a petition 
to put down not just the person's name and address, but 
also telephone number, so that they could be engaged in 
a conversation about what they had done? MR
 McKENNA: It -- it would depend on the strength of the State interest in having the 
telephone number
 The State does not have an interest in the telephone number on the petition form, because 
the State has -- only needs to know from the petition 
form the name and the address in order to verify --JUSTICE ALITO: I thought that you were saying that one of the interests that's served by this 
is to allow people who -- to allow Washington citizens 
to discuss this matter with those who signed the 
petition
 So putting down the telephone number would assist them in doing that
 MR
 McKENNA: It -- yes, it probably would make it easier for people to contact
 JUSTICE ALITO: So you would --MR
 McKENNA: But the policy --JUSTICE ALITO: You would endorse that? MR
 McKENNA: That would be a policy determination for the legislature to make,  
 Justice Alito
 JUSTICE ALITO: No, I'm not asking the policy question
 I'm asking whether the First Amendment would permit that
 MR
 McKENNA: I believe it could permit that, yes, Justice Alito
 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, one of your Co-Respondents says that supplying this information 
provides insight whether support comes predominantly 
from members of particular political or religious 
organizations
 Would it be consistent with the First Amendment to require anybody who signs a petition to 
list the person's religion? MR
 McKENNA: No, I do not believe it would, Justice Alito
 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that in  in Little Rock, a group of Little Rock citizens had wanted 
to put on the ballot a petition to require the school 
board to reopen Central High School, which had been 
closed because there was a sentiment in the community 
that they didn't want integration
 And it was pointed out that if they signed this petition, there was a very 
good chance that their businesses would be bombed, that 
they would certainly be boycotted, that their children  
 might be harassed
 Now, is there no First Amendment right in protecting those people? And if there is, how does it differ from your case? MR
 McKENNA: Justice Breyer, that is count 
 That is count  of the Petitioners' complaint
 This Court ruled as recently as Citizens United that such situations should be evaluated on a 
case-by-case basis to evaluate the reasonable 
probability of threats, harassments, and reprisals
 But that --JUSTICE SCALIA: So you -- you would have no objection to as an-applied challenge to disclosing the 
names of individuals to a particular cause, where it is 
demonstrated that the opponents of that cause are 
violent and will do violence to the people who signed 
the petition? MR
 McKENNA: Yes, Justice Scalia
 That would be the Socialist Workers Party case
 This -- this Court has ruled that, on a case-by-case basis, it is 
possible that some information otherwise disclosed --JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about a business boycott? JUSTICE SCALIA: So this is just a general challenge to ever, ever disclosing the names of petition  
 signers? MR
 McKENNA: Of any type of petition including nominating petitions --JUSTICE SCALIA: Right
 MR
 McKENNA: -- initiative petitions, and the rest
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about a business boycott? Suppose that were a -- a likely outcome of disclosing the name? MR
 McKENNA: Well, of course, boycotts have been upheld under the First Amendment in Claiborne 
Hardware, and so if someone wanted to boycott a business 
because it turned out that the manager of the business 
had been a supporter of a particular ballot measure, 
that would be allowable, of course, to that person 
choosing to boycott
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your answer to Justice Breyer was that they can bring an as-applied 
challenge
 Now, that as-applied challenge would be small comfort unless the names were protected pending 
the resolution of that challenge, correct? MR
 McKENNA: Yes
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think a stay should be granted in this case to allow the Petitioners 
to pursue an as-applied challenge
  
 MR
 McKENNA: Yes, of course -- yes, they could apply for another preliminary injunction if 
this Court upholds the court of appeals
 They were able to obtain that preliminary injunction in this case, 
which is why these petition forms have not been released 
to date, except under a protective order by the court to 
the opponents
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that would --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that the disclosure of the names, pending the resolution of 
their as-applied challenge, would subject them to 
incidents of violence and intimidation? MR
 McKENNA: We -- there is no evidence of that in the record
 There's no evidence --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does -- is it --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There™s no evidence -- there™s no evidence of episodes of violence 
or intimidation? MR
 McKENNA: Involving the Referendum  signers? No
 The evidence in the record is about people who were out circulating petitions, 
people who were out, you know, campaigning for the 
petitions, the campaign manager for the measure
 But none of the evidence in the record speaks to petition 
signers, and none of the evidence in the record speaks 
 to petition signers for other, similar measures which 
were cited by the Petitioners
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that because nobody got to count ? And the district court -- this whole case in the lower courts was on count  alone; wasn't 
that so? MR
 McKENNA: Yes, that is -- yes, that is correct
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And count  is the one that deals with the harassment
 MR
 McKENNA: That is true, Justice Ginsburg
 Of course, in several other States, Arkansas, Florida, and Massachusetts, which had similar 
measures regarding gay civil rights or same-sex marriage 
on the ballot -- in those three States, the petition 
forms were obtained under public records, were put on 
the Internet, and no evidence has been provided that™s 
in the record that anyone who signed any of those 
petitions in those three States was subjected to 
harassment --JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let's say somebody is thinking of circulating a petition on a sensitive 
subject and fears that people may be dissuaded from 
signing because they fear retaliation
 At what point could they bring this as-applied challenge?  
 Do they have to -- could they do it before they even begin to circulate the petition, arguing that 
if -- if these names -- if people are not assured ahead 
of time that their name and address is not going to be 
revealed to the public on the Internet, they™re not 
going to sign this? MR
 McKENNA: Justice Alito, it would be possible procedurally for them to bring the motion for 
an injunction even before collecting the signatures --JUSTICE ALITO: And how would they --MR
 McKENNA: -- if they had sufficient evidence
 JUSTICE ALITO: How would they prove that there™s -- that there™s a -- a threat, a sufficient 
threat of harassment in that particular case, before the 
petition is even signed? MR
 McKENNA: I believe that the sponsors of the measure would bring to the court 
evidence, if they have any, of -- because of the 
controversial nature of that particular measure, that is 
based on what's happened to some of the people who were 
planning to put the measure on the ballot
 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you -- you™ve rejected that here
 You™ve said there™s no evidence here that any of the petition -- petition signers were 
 subjected to any harassment
 MR
 McKENNA: Right
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course there isn't, because the names haven't gotten out yet
 How could you possibly demonstrate before the names get out that 
petition signers are going to be subjected to 
harassment? MR
 McKENNA: One could look to --JUSTICE SCALIA: Or otherwise, don't insist upon evidence that these very petition signers will be 
harassed
 MR
 McKENNA: I imagine, Justice Scalia, that the individuals moving for that preliminary 
injunction would do what the Petitioners have done in 
this case
 They would cite to an example from another State involving a comparable measure
 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you think that would be an acceptable type of evidence? MR
 McKENNA: They could bring it into the court
 I'm not saying the court would accept it, because I don't know --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if you don't think it's acceptable, then -- then -- then you™re not making 
an argument
 MR
 McKENNA: Justice Scalia, I didn't  
 say it couldn't be acceptable
 I'm saying this is a hypothetical, so I don't know what the evidence would 
look like in the hypothetical example
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the -- the hypothetical is that before this petition is circulated, 
the supporters came into court, and they said: Look what has happened in California with -- with Proposition 
 
Don't disclose -- enter an order prohibiting the public 
disclosure of the names and addresses here
 Would that be sufficient? MR
 McKENNA: Justice Alito, I think that the evidence would have to be very strong
 It would have to rise above criticism
 I think it would have to rise to the level of threatened violence
 It would have to rise to the level of the Socialist Workers 
Party case, for example, or the NAACP case
 I think the standard would be very high
 But it would be up to the trial judge to decide whether 
or not the evidence was sufficient to issue the 
preliminary injunction
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- the State has had this procedure now for some time, and there have 
been controversial ballot initiatives
 Is there any history in the State of Washington that signers have 
been subject to harassment?  
 MR
 McKENNA: There has not, Justice Ginsburg, and that's even though a half a dozen 
initiatives on a variety of topics have been released
 
Another half dozen are pending
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what's the most sensitive similar petition for a referendum? MR
 McKENNA: There has been no measure on domestic partner benefits or same-sex marriage in 
Washington State --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but what™s the --MR
 McKENNA: -- but there are other --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What™s -- what's the other one that's going to get people -- that's the most controversial public issue? MR
 McKENNA: Justice --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Proposition ? MR
 McKENNA: Well --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm talking about in Washington, counsel
 MR
 McKENNA: In Washington State
 Mr
 Chief Justice, we have had measures on assisted 
suicide, for example, which was very controversial, 
and -- and there™s no evidence involving that set of 
petitions
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was the referendum 
 in favor or opposed to assisted suicide? MR
 McKENNA: It was -- well, the referendum challenges the assisted suicide law
 So if you vote for the referendum, you vote to uphold the 
legislature's adoption of that law, which -- which 
allowed assisted suicide
 So there have been controversial measures
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This case will likely be controlled by our First Amendment precedents, because 
that's the most fully developed
 Did you look at the Petition Clause at all? In the early days of the republic, the petitions were 
the way in which you communicated with your legislator
 MR
 McKENNA: Yes
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I tried to look it up
 I have a recollection, but I'm not sure, that those 
petitions were sometimes put in the Congressional 
Record
 But did you look at the history of the Petition Clause? MR
 McKENNA: Justice Kennedy, we have considered the history of the Petition Clause, and we 
see a basic difference between the kinds of petitions 
under the Petition Clause and the petitions at issue 
here because, essentially, petitioning the government 
under the Petition Clause is asking the government to do  
 something
 You™re petitioning them: Please do something
 The petitions for a referendum or an initiative are telling the government to do something
 
The petition form says that I, the signer, am directing 
the Secretary of State to conduct an election
 And by submitting these petitions in a referendum, I am 
suspending the law which the legislature has already 
approved until the election has taken place
 Tell versus ask
 I think that's a pretty big -- a significant difference
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, of course, that can cut the other way, too, because then it's more like a 
vote
 And there -- there is strong interest in keeping the -- the vote private
 MR
 McKENNA: And, Justice Kennedy, I™d like to speak to that question, because several 
Justices asked: Well, what can we tell from what, you know, someone who signed? Do we know how they™re going to vote
 I -- I agree that many people signing a petition are going to vote in favor of -- in the case of 
an initiative, in favor of the law the initiative would 
put on the ballot
 But also we know from the social science research, which is cited, for example, in the  
 Direct Democracy Scholars green brief, that many people 
sign simply because they believe it's important for 
the -- for the public to have an opportunity to vote
 
And, of course, as the Petitioners have acknowledged and 
we also point out, some people vote just to get around the 
circulator and get into the store
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What percentage --what percentage of the people who signed this petition 
to put this law on the referendum do you think signed it 
because they think these sort of things should be 
generally put to a public vote as opposed to because 
they opposed the law? MR
 McKENNA: The percentage of people who believe simply that there should be a vote held has 
not been quantified by the research, except that several 
scholars indicate that it is significant
 So, whether it's  percent or  percent, I -- I really can't say 
within a certain --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think as much as  percent of the people who signed this petition are 
actually in favor of the law that it's aimed to repeal? MR
 McKENNA: It is possible
 But it's also possible some of those  percent don't have an 
opinion on the law, Mr
 Chief Justice
 They simply think that there should be a vote held, and they™ll  
 make their mind up later on
 There are plenty of people who aren't aware when certain laws are -- are adopted that are subjected 
to a referendum, and they may not have decided at all
 
In fact, one of the reasons they may sign the petition 
is to say: Well, I'm not sure how I'm going to vote, but, you know, I think a public vote would be a good 
idea
 So, I'm going to let it go forward to be on the ballot, and I™ll decide
 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this question? It seems to me your -- the strongest State interest here 
is detecting fraud
 And you mentioned that the records are digitized
 And maybe you can correct my impression of this, but it seems to me that if the records are 
digitized, there are very simple ways of detecting fraud 
that would not require the disclosure of the list to the 
public
 If somebody wants to see whether his or her name has been fraudulently put on the list, wouldn't it 
be very simple to set up a Web site where the person 
could put in a little bit of identifying information and 
see whether that person's name is on the list? And if the -- the purpose is to see whether a particular person 
lives at a particular address, couldn't you just 
cross-reference by means of a computer program the  
 information on the referendum with the -- with the 
voting lists? So if you've got John Jones who lives at  Main Street, you see whether there really is a 
registered voter John Jones who lives at  Main Street? 
Why does this all have to be put out on the Internet? MR
 McKENNA: Justice Alito, the -- just to be clear, you are right
 They do use computer --computers because when -- in the verification process, 
the Secretary of State™s staff, with the observers looking 
over their shoulder, will look at the petition and look 
up that voter in an -- in an electronic voter 
registration database
 This is exactly why the information is so useful to the public as well
 They have access to electronic online voter registration history as well, 
and they can also check
 In -- in Massachusetts, under their public records law in , petition forms obtained by public 
records requests were put online, and over , people, 
as has been documented in the Lambda amicus brief, 
discovered that they -- their names are on petitions 
that they claimed did not sign, and discovered that they 
had been, in some cases, misled
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what's the answer to  
 my question? Couldn't you -- couldn't this be done very simply? If I want to see whether somebody has fraudulently signed my name, very quickly go to a 
Web site, wouldn't be expensive to set up, put in your 
voter ID number, and see whether -- and your name, and 
see whether you™re on the -- on the --MR
 McKENNA: Yes
 JUSTICE ALITO: -- whether you --somebody signed your name to the petition? MR
 McKENNA: Yes, Justice Alito, that -- that could be done
 In our State and the other States that's done when somebody requests the public 
records and chooses them to put online
 The State doesn't -- does not put the petition forms online 
itself, although, you know, other information is put 
online by the State
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do -- do we take this case on the assumption -- do you make the contention before 
us that the Secretary of State and those who assist it 
are not capable of determining whether the petition 
signatures are valid? MR
 McKENNA: No, we are not taking that position, Justice Kennedy
 Of course --JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean without public disclosure?  
 MR
 McKENNA: What we know, Justice Kennedy, is that in dozens of States around 
the -- around the country, as recently as  in 
Maryland,  in Massachusetts, and so on, it was 
the -- it was the public who requested ballot petitions 
by public records request who found significant fraud 
and error
 This isn't just about fraud -- fraud is very important -- it's also about finding plain old mistakes 
which the State, Secretary of State, or auditor has 
missed
 That -- that does happen with regularity in this country, and we cite cases in our brief where error 
is not fraud, but errors in Washington State have been 
discovered by people who look at these public records
 
And --JUSTICE SCALIA: Sometimes the public may not trust the Secretary of State
 MR
 McKENNA: Yes, sir
 Justice Scalia, we agree
 JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it may be an issue in which his administration has taken a particularly firm 
stand, and the public may not trust the job that the 
Secretary of State does
 MR
 McKENNA: That goes to the heart to the Public Records Act, Justice Scalia: Trust but 
 verify
 The people did not leave to the State the idea that, well, we™ll let you know what you need to know
 
The people want a --JUSTICE SCALIA: Trust but verify -- I like that
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE GINSBURG: You did say something about this category of speech
 You said, well, this is in the category that -- it's like O'Brien
 It has speech elements and non-speech elements
 And I was trying to figure out which -- what is it in the signature that 
speaks and what is it in the signature that doesn't 
speak? MR
 McKENNA: The speech element could be construed in the fact that someone has chosen to sign 
a petition which we know means they want something to be 
put on the ballot
 So, they favor having it on the ballot
 That -- that much we know
 But we also looked to Burdick, of course, because in this -- in -- in the Burdick decision this 
Court held that write-in voting could be prohibited by 
the State of Hawaii
 That was upheld by the court of appeals and this Court
 And this Court found that writing in a candidate's name was not even expressive 
conduct
  
 So we look to the Burdick level of intermediate scrutiny, to the O'Brien level of 
intermediate scrutiny for the test
 Justice Ginsburg, the other point I wanted to bring up is something about Buckley II, which --JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is the -- to finish your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, what is the 
non-speech component of signing a petition? MR
 McKENNA: The non-speech component is suspension of law in the case of a referendum or the 
legislative effect
 We believe this is a legislative act fundamentally
 In --JUSTICE ALITO: And what's the State's interest in regulating the non-speech component? When you --when you talk about the vote cast by an elected 
representative, of course, there's a strong interest in 
knowing how an elected representative voted, because the 
representative is answerable to the voters
 But somebody who signs a petition isn™t answerable to 
anybody -- any other citizen
 So what™s your interest? MR
 McKENNA: The interest, Justice Alito, is knowing, first of all, that there were a 
sufficient number of signatures submitted to qualify the 
measure for the ballot
 JUSTICE ALITO: It™s the fraud interest? 
 MR
 McKENNA: That's the fraud interest
 And, secondly, there is a valid informational interest in knowing who is it exactly who™s calling for 
this election and suspending the --JUSTICE ALITO: Well, but how far does that go? When I asked whether you could -- you want to know the religion of the people who signed, no, you can't do 
that
 How much more demographic information could be -- could be -- does the -- does the State of 
Washington have an interest in making publicly available 
about the people who support this election? Let's say it's -- it's a referendum about immigration
 Does the State of Washington have an interest in providing information to somebody who says 
I want to know how many people with Hispanic names 
signed this, or how many people with Asian names signed 
this? Is that -- that what you want to facilitate? MR
 McKENNA: No, Justice Alito, we don't need to know that
 We need to know whether there were a sufficient number of registered voters who 
signed -- we need to know whether they signed more than 
once
 We need to know they are registered in Washington State
 Informational interest I think that you could -- the information you could collect to satisfy 
 informational interest might include other information 
that™s in the voter registration records
 You might want to know --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought one of the reasons you wanted to do this was so people would have 
information that would allow them to participate in the 
civic process, and there are people who -- might think 
it makes a difference whether a referendum was requested 
by -- primarily by members of a particular ethnic group 
or not
 So isn't -- doesn't -- I thought your brief would say the State has an interest in that type of 
disclosure
 MR
 McKENNA: I don't see what the valid State interest would be of knowing the ethnicity of the 
person
 I mean, of course, anyone could look at the petition ballot forms and, I suppose, divine something about 
the ethnicity based on the last name, but the State's 
interest doesn't go -- go to that
 That we -- we don't believe we need to know that
 We believe we need to know what is requested -- required on the -- on the 
petition form
 JUSTICE ALITO: Then I don't understand what information is being -- what information you think you™re 
providing to the public
 Outside of the fraud area, if I see that John Jones from Seattle signed this  
 petition, that tells me absolutely nothing
 MR
 McKENNA: Well, Justice Alito, it might -- if you know John Jones, that would tell you something
 Number two, we know from the -- we know from the, you know, Direct Democracy Scholars green brief 
that intermediaries and especially the press and 
sometimes social science researchers and others will --
will look at the names, and they™ll be able to tell, 
for example, that a large number of employees at one 
company signed a measure; maybe it's a measure that would cut 
a tax break for a particular industry
 Or perhaps members of a union, in large numbers, have signed
 They have been --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can they --MR
 McKENNA: -- able to provide that information
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can they find that out with just the name and address, that a large number of people 
from a company signed it? MR
 McKENNA: Well --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have to put on who you work for, do you? MR
 McKENNA: No, you do not
 I'm saying intermediaries might discover this, for example, 
by taking a close look at who™s paying for the signature gathering
 If it's paid signature gathering,  
 they might be aware of prominent sponsors
 In fact, the -- the importance of knowing who the sponsors is, is 
demonstrated --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry
 I'm still on the companies
 How -- how does knowing who the sponsors are tell you how many people from a particular 
company signed the petition? MR
 McKENNA: Well, a voter who -- who works at that same company or does business with that 
same company might know that, gosh, I know these 
employees, and they've -- they have all signed this 
petition
 The press might be able to do the research to find that out
 Intermediaries do play an important role
 The last point, if I may, I wanted to make about -- about Buckley II is that the Petitioners have 
stressed that Buckley II struck down the requirement to wear 
the name badge
 But in that same decision this Court upheld the requirement by Colorado that affidavits 
signed by the petition circulators, including the 
petition circulator's name and address, can be disclosed 
as public records
 And the Court ruled that -- found that and compared it favorably to the badge requirement because 
the disclosures of public record occurred after the heat 
of the moment, after the moment of interactive discussion
  
 It happened later on
 And we believe, of all the Court's rulings, that -- that approval of the disclosure requirement of the -- of the affidavit, in contrast to the badges, is the most similar to requiring after the fact or allowing 
after the fact for petitions to be disclosed under the Public Records Act
 JUSTICE ALITO: You know, if somebody called your office and said I'd like the -- the home 
address of all the attorneys who work in the Attorney General™s Office because we want to -- we want to go to 
their homes and have uncomfortable conversations with them --(Laughter
) JUSTICE ALITO: -- which is what has been alleged here, would you release that information? MR
 McKENNA: We would not, Justice Alito
 We would not release it because they can come to the office and have uncomfortable conversations with them --(Laughter
) MR
 McKENNA: -- which I can personally attest happens with some regularity
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that information, at least the names of those people -- isn't it probably  
 public information anyway? MR
 McKENNA: Yes, it is, Justice Scalia
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can it be obtained under the Freedom of Information Act in this case? MR
 McKENNA: Yes, it can
 Their names, their office locations, their office phone numbers, 
their office e-mails is all a matter of public record in 
our State
 Thank you very much
 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General McKenna
 Mr
 Bopp, you have  minutes remaining
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR
, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS MR
 BOPP: Thank you
 First a clarification of what we sought in the preliminary injunction
 We were -- we sought to base our preliminary injunction on 
both count  and count 
 Of course, the district court and the Ninth Circuit did not reach -- in either 
case -- reach count 
 Secondly, with respect to whether or not there™s any conduct here, I don't think signing a 
written statement is conduct
 And, of course, by signing the statement, the person is adopting the statement on  
Official MR
 SRINIVASAN: He has to have been convicted of a crime --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- which may be a misdemeanor, which would subject him to a felony conviction in 
Federal court under the Controlled Substances Act
 And I think that's - that's what this is
 He's convicted of a drug offense, and if - if he were prosecuted in Federal 
court, he would -- he was punishable as a felon --MR
 SRINIVASAN: He was --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- in Federal court under the -- under the Controlled Substances Act
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: He was not punishable as a felon in Federal court for two reasons: First, he was convicted of drug possession
 A person in Federal court who is convicted of drug possession is a misdemeanant, 
not a felon, unless and until there™s a finding that 
he's a recidivist
 You have to have the finding of recidivist in order for a felony sentence even to 
conceivably attach to an individual, and you just don't 
have that in the context of this case, where all you 
have is a conviction of drug possession alone
 A felony sentence doesn't even come into the picture unless there™s 
a finding of recidivism
 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn™t the --MR
 SRINIVASAN: That didn't happen in the 
Official State court
 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn™t the crux of your argument that for present purposes the term "conviction" must 
include a determination of recidivism? MR
 SRINIVASAN: For present purposes, that's correct
 And Justice Alito, I think it's important to understand -- and this goes to the second 
response to your question, Justice Scalia -- that the 
statute, the Immigration and Nationality Act, defines 
"conviction" in a particular way
 It defines "conviction" as "a formal judgment of guilt – entered by 
a court
" As Your Honor's opinion for the Court in Deal v
 United States understood, statutes could define 
convictions in one of two ways: It could define a conviction as a finding of guilty, or it could define a 
conviction as the formal judgment based on that finding
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what would you say --MR
 SRINIVASAN: Here we have the latter
 JUSTICE ALITO: What do you say about  U
S
C
 section , the Federal recidivism provision, 
which says: "No person who stands convicted of an offense under this part shall be sentenced to increased punishment 
by reason of one or more prior convictions
" So under that statute, the conviction does not  
Official include the recidivism determination
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: Under --JUSTICE ALITO: Isn™t that right? MR
 SRINIVASAN: Under that statute --different statutes conceive of it different ways, but 
the applicable definition of "conviction" here, because 
we™re talking about an immigration consequence, is 
the definition of "conviction" under the Immigration and 
Nationality Act
 And that definition is set forth at page a of the appendix to our brief, the blue brief, 
the opening brief
 And it's  U
S
C
 (a)()(A), and it says that: "The term 'conviction' means, with respect to an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the 
alien entered by a court
" And so, here you have "a formal judgment of guilt" as the operative definition of a conviction, and 
that formal judgment of guilt includes both the 
adjudication of guilt and the sentence
 And so the important point to bear in mind is that at the time that 
the conviction, as defined by the Immigration and 
Nationality Act, is entered, we know whether the person 
has been found to have been a recidivist
 At that point, the adjudication of guilt has happened, the sentence has 
been imposed, and we know whether a finding of recidivism 
has been made
 In the absence of such a finding, the  
Official maximum sentence they could attach under Federal law, 
Justice Scalia, is a misdemeanor sentence of  year of 
imprisonment
 A felony sentence is not on the table, and if the maximum sentence to which a person is subject is 
a misdemeanor sentence, the person has been -- has been 
convicted of a misdemeanor; they haven't been convicted 
of a felony
 And that --JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's assume we™re not talking about immigration consequences
 Let's -- let's assume we™re talking about an American citizen who has 
committed a -- a misdemeanor drug offense
 When he is brought up under the Controlled Substances Act, even 
though he wasn't found to have been a recidivist by the 
State conviction, couldn't he be prosecuted under the 
Controlled Substances Act for a felony because in fact 
he is a recidivist? MR
 SRINIVASAN: Oh, sure
 But -- but I think -- I think that confuses two things
 In that situation, the second proceeding is in Federal court --JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: -- and in that Federal court proceeding, you can take account of the prior State court 
conviction, but in that second proceeding, the fact that 
he was convicted previously in State court would have to  
Official have been found by the Federal court
 That's the relevant finding of recidivism, and in the absence of that finding of 
recidivism, the Federal defendant wouldn't be subject to 
a felony sentence
 He would only be subject to a misdemeanor sentence
 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but -- the crucial word here is "punishable" as a felony under the Controlled 
Substances Act
 And the fact is if indeed he™s a recidivist, he could be punished for the -- for the 
felony
 Now, you™re quite correct that the Federal court would have to find the recidivism, but -- but 
still he would be punishable as a recidivist
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: He has to be convicted of a felony, Justice Scalia, and in the absence of a finding 
of recidivism, he can't have been convicted of the 
felony
 He may be punishable as a felon in the abstract ex ante
 So I don't take issue with the proposition that a person commits recidivist possession when they 
commit possession and they have a prior conviction
 In that abstract sense, the person has committed recidivist 
possession, and if they were charged and found to have 
been a recidivist, they would be convicted of recidivist 
possession
 But in the absence of that finding, they haven't been convicted of recidivist possession, and --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under the applicable  
Official State law, what™s required before the recidivist 
sentence is triggered? Is it a formal finding of recidivism by the -- by a jury? MR
 SRINIVASAN: It doesn't have to be by a jury, and I think it would depend on the State, 
Mr
 Chief Justice
 It doesn't necessarily have to be by a jury, because I think several States have the 
recidivism component of the offense as a finding that 
could be made by the court, but the --JUSTICE SCALIA: And we've held that™s okay --MR
 SRINIVASAN: And you've held --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that you don™t need a jury
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: -- that's okay as a constitutional matter
 But --JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we have five States, isn't it, that have no recidivist provisions? MR
 SRINIVASAN: There are --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the thrust of your argument or the logical consequence of your argument, if 
you have one of those States with no recidivist 
provisions and you have ten separate possession 
convictions, they're still not a recidivist under the 
Federal rules? MR
 SRINIVASAN: It is in those five States,  
Official Justice Kennedy, but I don't think that should give the 
Court a great deal of pause, for the following two 
reasons
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no
 In my hypothetical, what would happen if -- if there was a 
deportation proceeding? MR
 SRINIVASAN: What would happen is this: The person would not be categorically ineligible for 
discretionary relief
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because there is no recidivist finding
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: They wouldn't have been convicted of recidivist possession
 But it's important to note, Justice Kennedy, that doesn't mean that those 
prior convictions don't enter into the picture at all
 
They do, because, in the exercise of discretion by the 
Attorney General, the Attorney General can take into 
account any prior convictions, including those that 
don't render somebody categorically ineligible
 All we™re talking about here is whether the person has a chance to make a discretionary case
 They do have that chance in Your Honor's hypothetical, but 
those convictions would be taken into account
 Now, I want to point out, though, that there™s another reason that I think the fact that in that  
Official hypothetical it wouldn't render the defendant categorically ineligible for discretionary relief 
shouldn't give the Court a great deal of pause
 And that's because the relevant category of aggravated 
felony that we're talking about here is illicit 
trafficking in a controlled substance
 That's the category that's outlined by the statute
 Now, with respect to that category, every State has trafficking laws
 Every State punishes drug trafficking
 So every State's offenses do count for purposes of this category of aggravated felony
 When we™re -- that's the iceberg
 The tip of the iceberg is recidivist possession, which is a subset of illicit 
trafficking in a controlled substance
 Now, with respect to that tip, Federal convictions for recidivist possession 
still do count, so we have those
 With respect to the State --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but the State prosecutors often prosecute when they have a recidivist 
provision under that, rather than the much more difficult 
illicit trafficking crime
 I mean, if you™re going to go to jail for a certain amount of years for a 
recidivist possession, that's easier to show than illicit 
trafficking
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: Well, sure, but if a State -- two responses, Mr
 Chief Justice: If a State  
Official prosecutor does prosecute under an available recidivist 
possession offense, then that would count because the 
State prosecutor would have brought the charge, the 
finding by hypothesis would have been made
 That would be felony recidivist possession under Federal law, and 
there would be categorical ineligibility
 Now, I think what may be -- what may be sort of lurking beneath Your Honor's question is the 
recognition that the Federal consequences of a State 
conviction are going to turn on State prosecutorial 
decisions
 That's true
 But that's a fixed feature of any scheme in which Federal immigration consequences 
turns on what happens in State court, and this Court's 
decision in Lopez recognizes that
 For example, States -- several States don't have a Federal offense of possession with intent to 
distribute drugs
 That's a Federal offense
 What States, some States, have instead is possession with a 
degree of penalty attached to the amount of drugs 
possessed
 They don't have the separate offense of possession with intent to distribute
 Now, the fact that certain States don't have that offense doesn't mean that an individual who is 
convicted of state possession with no finding of an 
intent to distribute would be categorically ineligible  
Official for discretionary relief from removal, because what 
Congress understood was that some States will have 
qualifying offenses and some States won't
 In those States that do, where the State has the offense and 
where the State prosecutor makes the decision to charge 
under that offense will -- at that point the State 
conviction will count as a Federal felony
 It will be a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, 
and the person at that point would be categorically 
ineligible for discretionary relief
 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know
 It seems to me you go further than you need to and, moreover, 
imagine a State offense that just says possession of 
marijuana, zero to  years
 Now, our problem is, reading those words, is that or is that not analogous to 
a Federal -- a Federal -- what a Federal law would make 
a felony? And suppose you discovered as a matter of fact that all the people who did have a prior conviction 
got more than a year
 In simple possession, they got less than a year, which you™d have to do research to 
find out
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: Right
 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if those were the facts, I would say it is analogous to the Federal 
felony where this person was sentenced to more than a  
Official year
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: I don't think it would be, Justice Breyer, because --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, we could argue that one --MR
 SRINIVASAN: Sure
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- but I don't see where --that there™s a line, because it seems to me the rule is 
set forth -- we said in the last sentence here of --
what's the case? You know --MR
 SRINIVASAN: Lopez? JUSTICE BREYER: What? MR
 SRINIVASAN: Is it Lopez? Is that --JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, Lopez
 It says: "A state offense constitutes a ‚felony punishable under the 
Controlled Substances Act™ only if it proscribes 
conduct
" So we™re not looking at what happened in reality
 We™re reading some words from a State statute
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: Correct
 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that Federal law
 
This would be normal
 We get some words in the State statute, and you have to decide are the -- those 
words cover some events in the world
 And you look at  
Official those words, what -- the events they cover and discover, 
did they or are they analogous or not analogous to what 
is a felony under Federal law? Sometimes that's easy, sometimes it's not
 You have a case, I think, that's easy
 But I can imagine the case you™re talking about, not easy
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: Well, I --JUSTICE BREYER: So you say, what do you do? I see no rule there
 I see no rule absolute how you treat it, so I probably would treat it by trying to look at what 
really happens under this statute in the world
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: Well -- well, with respect, Justice Breyer, I don't think that's the inquiry that's 
called for even by this sentence
 I think what this sentence called for is an inquiry into what the State 
offense captures in its offense elements to make up a 
conviction
 JUSTICE BREYER: Why -- where does it say "offense element"? MR
 SRINIVASAN: Because I think that's the -- the necessary inquiry that™s --JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that? MR
 SRINIVASAN: It's -- it's necessarily what's at issue
 It --JUSTICE BREYER: Why?  
Official MR
 SRINIVASAN: This sentence doesn't necessarily -- it asks whether --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, where in the statute --MR
 SRINIVASAN: It asks whether it proscribes conduct
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- does it say "offense elements"? MR
 SRINIVASAN: It asks whether -- the sentence asks whether the State offense proscribes conduct
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: And I read "proscribes conduct" to mean there would be offense elements of proscribed conduct
 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you say that it says "elements
" I don't see any of our cases that say "elements
" And I -- and I think that -- that what we could do is look to the conduct that's likely to be at 
issue under these State words, and if in fact it's 
regular that the State does punish people for more than a year when in fact they do possess for the third time, at least there would be a good argument --MR
 SRINIVASAN: Justice Breyer --JUSTICE BREYER: -- that that counts
 You want to argue it doesn't count, okay
 I don't know why you do
 
Official MR
 SRINIVASAN: No --JUSTICE BREYER: But, I mean, I'm interested in why you do, since that isn't your case
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: Yes, I don't want to take issue -- I don't want to argue against myself, 
certainly, but I would just make the following point: 
That if I™m understanding what Your Honor is saying 
correctly, and I'm not sure that I am, but if I™m 
understanding what you're saying correctly, I would just 
point out to the Court that the Court dealt with that 
sort of situation in the four corners of Lopez itself 
when it talked about -- talks about what happens with 
possession with intent to distribute
 Some States don't have possession with intent to distribute as an offense; they only have 
possession
 Now, I -- as I understand what Your Honor is suggesting, you could look at all the -- the ken of 
individuals who have been convicted of State possession 
and you could ask as a matter of fact, do they in fact 
possess with intent to distribute? And then you could reach some consequence on that basis
 JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but the reason I ask my question is it seems to me your approach, which I 
think is consistent with Lopez and Nijhawan 
absolutely --
Official MR
 SRINIVASAN: Okay
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- does raise the question you are talking about
 So I want to know: Why are you talking about it? Because I might be missing something, because I don't think -- if I'm right, your case doesn't raise these issues
 Or am I wrong about that? MR
 SRINIVASAN: I -- I have to confess, I'm not exactly sure what Your Honor is asking
 So --JUSTICE BREYER: Okay
 Well, skip the question
 (Laughter
) MR
 SRINIVASAN: I think --JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this question --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I --JUSTICE ALITO: If -- suppose a State makes simple possession a felony
 Now, that doesn't make it a felony for these purposes, right? MR
 SRINIVASAN: Right
 JUSTICE ALITO: All right
 But in sentencing the -- the defendant in State court for this 
felony, the -- the defendant concedes that he had a 
prior conviction, and the judge finds that and takes that 
into account in imposing the sentence
 What would happen there? 
Official MR
 SRINIVASAN: It wouldn't constitute the analogy to the Federal offense of recidivist possession, 
Justice -- Justice Alito, because that could also happen 
in the Federal system
 In the Federal system, you could have an individual who is convicted of possession, and 
then the fact that they had a prior conviction could 
have some role in the -- for example, in the 
presentencing report
 JUSTICE ALITO: But what's missing there? MR
 SRINIVASAN: You don't have --JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference between that and -- and a situation where, just because 
of the vagary of State law, recidivism is something that 
has to be proven in order to bring the offense into the 
-- into the felony level? MR
 SRINIVASAN: Two things are missing, Justice Alito: First, you don't have a formal judgment of guilt entered by the court, which is what 
a conviction requires
 And the consequence of not having a formal judgment of guilt is that the statutory 
maximum penalty isn't raised
 And I think what™s relevant here is that when you have a finding of -- a 
formal judgment of guilt of recidivism in the Federal 
system, which happens when the prosecutor brings a 
charge and the court makes the finding at sentencing, 
Official the maximum sentence that could be imposed against the 
defendant is raised from a misdemeanor sentence to a 
felony sentence
 But that doesn't happen in a situation in which the fact of a prior conviction is taken into 
account, for example, under a presentencing report
 It doesn't raise the statutory maximum, and there™s no 
formal judgment entered based on that determination by 
the court
 And so that's the distinction
 And I think the relevant way to look at it is you take account of what would happen in the Federal 
system and you ask: Would it have the consequence in the Federal system of rendering somebody guilty of the 
felony of recidivist possession as opposed to the 
misdemeanor of simple possession? And it wouldn't in the Federal system, and by parity of reasoning it also 
would not have that consequence in the State system
 JUSTICE ALITO: That seems to be a totally formalistic distinction that's based on the vagaries of 
State law
 What -- what is the difference between someone who is found by a court under a State recidivism 
provision to have -- to be eligible for an increased 
punishment as a result of that finding and someone who 
is found by a court in the context of sentencing, 
discretionary sentencing, to have a felony possession,  
Official to have a prior -- a prior conviction and receives an increased sentence as a result of that? MR
 SRINIVASAN: Well --JUSTICE ALITO: What is the -- is there any functional difference between those two situations? MR
 SRINIVASAN: Well, I think there is, Justice Alito, and let me just say as a preliminary 
matter it's not based on the vagaries of State law, 
because it's -- I'm applying the same analysis to State 
convictions as I do to -- to Federal convictions
 But one way to look at it is to ask, suppose that a State or even Federal law made it salient for 
sentencing purposes whether somebody intended to 
distribute when they possessed
 They were convicted of drug possession
 There is an offense of possession with intent to distribute, but they™re not charged with that 
offense; they™re charged with drug possession
 And then sentencing somehow makes it salient, not for 
purposes of raising the statutory maximum, but just for 
purposes of sentencing within the range whether the 
person intended to distribute
 I don't think anybody would say that the individual was convicted of the felony of possession 
with intent to distribute because the -- the judge in 
sentencing took into account an intent to distribute  
Official in some way under a sentencing scheme
 JUSTICE ALITO: But does it matter in that situation that that's an element, that has to be an 
element of the offense? MR
 SRINIVASAN: It has to be a sentencing factor that raises the statutory maximum
 And the reason that matters is that under this statute, the 
person has to have been convicted of a felony, and the 
only way they™re convicted of a felony is the offense 
of which they are convicted can lead to a felony 
sentence
 And the sentencing factor in this case of recidivism is necessary in order to give rise to a 
Federal sentence
 In the absence of that finding, the person has been convicted of a misdemeanor, because the 
maximum sentence they can receive is a misdemeanor 
sentence of  year of imprisonment
 If the Court has no further questions, I™d like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr
 Srinivasan
 Ms
 Saharsky
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A
 SAHARSKY ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MS
 SAHARSKY: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it  
Official please the Court: Congress's judgment here was that all aliens who engage in the same serious conduct would be treated 
the same for immigration purposes
 And Petitioner doesn't dispute that he has two convictions for drug 
possession, and he also doesn't dispute that had that 
second case been prosecuted in Federal court, he could 
have been punished as a felon
 What he is saying is: I don't want my aggravated felony to count because of a 
difference in State law, because of a difference in the 
State prosecutor's decision
 But what this Court held in Lopez is that Congress's judgment controls about the seriousness of 
the offense
 JUSTICE BREYER: The exact words of Lopez, which I think are important: "We hold that a State offense constitutes a felony punishable under 
Controlled Substance – only if it proscribes conduct 
punishable as a felony
" Okay? MS
 SAHARSKY: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: Under Federal law
 Now, there™s an ambiguity when you use a word like "offense" 
or "crime
" Sometimes you mean what this guy did, and sometimes you're referring to a statute
 It's statutes that proscribe, not what this guy did
 So we™re  
Official talking about the statute
 So what it tells us to do --and we said the same thing in Nijhawan, and I have 
written in other opinions the same thing -- you go read 
the State statute
 Forget what he's done
 Read the statute and see if the statute proscribes conduct that 
would amount to a felony under Federal law
 So let us read the statute
 We turn to the statute of conviction
 What it says is it is a class A misdemeanor for which you are punishable of less than a 
year if you possess less than  grams or whatever
 It says nothing about recidivism
 There is no increased punishment for recidivism
 So all we did was read the statute
 The statute does not proscribe conduct that would be a 
felony under Federal law; it proscribes conduct that 
would be a misdemeanor
 QED
 This person has not been punished in Texas under a statute that proscribes 
conduct that would be a felony under Federal law
 End of case
 Now, what is the matter with what I just said? MS
 SAHARSKY: Because this is a two-step inquiry and you only did step one
 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you mean, ﬁa two-step inquiryﬂ?  
Official MS
 SAHARSKY: A two-step inquiry
 There are two questions
 The first is: Does the State offense correspond to an offense under the CSA? Does it correspond to a Federal offense, and that™s based on 
the elements, and the Court said that that was based on 
the elements on page  of Nijhawan --JUSTICE BREYER: Okay
 Okay
 MS
 SAHARSKY: But there™s a second question, which is: If it corresponds to a Federal offense, how would that Federal offense be punishable? 
The "punishable" under the CSA language determines that 
we need to look at that second inquiry
 JUSTICE BREYER: No --MS
 SAHARSKY: If in addition to that --JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that? Where does it say that in the language? You are looking to the conduct that the statute proscribes, not what he engaged in
 Suppose the State statute says it is a misdemeanor to steal a 
chicken, okay? MS
 SAHARSKY: Yes
 JUSTICE BREYER: It is a misdemeanor
 He is convicted of stealing a chicken
 It turns out that the way he stole the chicken was to burn down the farmhouse
 (Laughter
) 
Official JUSTICE BREYER: That is a felony
 Now, what we have written is: Forget the second
 I™ve written it in five opinions or four or three, most of 
which had a majority
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE BREYER: It is called -- it is written right here in this case
 It is written in Nijhawan
 What is it that tells us to go beyond the conduct that the State statute proscribes, not some 
other thing? MS
 SAHARSKY: The conduct is what the State statute proscribes, but there™s an additional question 
of how it is punishable --JUSTICE BREYER: Where is the additional question? Read me the words of the statute that --there might be
 I'm not -- I'm being argumentative, but I want to know what words in the statute say there -- or 
what words in a case say go look to some other thing 
beyond what the State statute proscribes? MS
 SAHARSKY: Okay
 This is on the gray brief, page a, and this is the definition that is 
incorporated into the aggravated felony definition in 
the INA, and it says that it encompasses, quote, "any 
felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act
" 
And in Lopez the Court interpreted that language to mean 
Official an offense that is punishable as a felony under the 
Controlled Substances Act
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes
 What offense? The offense proscribed --MS
 SAHARSKY: Right
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- by State law
 That's why I asked you: Where does the State statute proscribe something that has to do with recidivism? I™ve read that State statute three or four times
 MS
 SAHARSKY: Recidivism isn't part of the offense
 It is a sentencing factor
 Justice Scalia mentioned that
 That's something this Court has recognized on many occasions, that recidivism is 
something that can be established by the sentencing 
court
 You are right: The offense is drug possession
 He was convicted of drug possession in State court
 That's what he would have been convicted of in Federal court
 But the fact that he was convicted of drug possession doesn't answer the separate question 
of how that offense is punishable
 If it were his first offense, it would be punishable as a misdemeanor
 If it was his second offense, it would be punishable as a 
felony
 And we think that that -- that approach is  
Official dictated by two different opinions, the first of which 
is Lopez, which says we look for a correspondence 
between the State offense and the Federal offense, but 
then we also have this question of how the offense is 
punishable in Federal court, and this punishability 
question is extremely relevant
 The entire basis for the Court's -- the entire basis for the Court's opinion 
was that Congress's judgment about the seriousness of 
the offense controls
 It is not State by State judgment
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms
 Saharsky, do we take into account at all -- I mean, in Lopez as I understand 
it, the petitioner prevailed because it would not have 
been a felony under the Federal law
 Is that right? MS
 SAHARSKY: Yes
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Here we™re talking about two crimes
 One is a small amount of marijuana
 He gets  days in jail
 The other is a pill that I never heard of, a Xan-something, and then he gets, what,  days 
in jail for that
 If you could just present this scenario to an intelligent person who didn't go to law school, 
as you're going to not only remove him from this 
country, but say never, ever darken our doors again 
because of one marijuana cigarette and one Xan-something 
pill -- it -- it just seems to me that if there™s a way  
Official of reading the statute that would not lead to that 
absurd result, you would want to read the statute
 If you are forced to read it because there™s no other way -- but maybe there is another way
 MS
 SAHARSKY: We don't think that there is another way, because the Court said in Lopez in 
interpreting the statutory language that the State's 
judgment about how an offense is punished does not 
control
 What controls is Congress's judgment, and Congress has taken a hard line over the past  years on 
criminal aliens, particularly recidivist criminal 
aliens --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it has --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me what --MS
 SAHARSKY: -- particularly --JUSTICE KENNEDY: What would happen if there -- forget the State
 There are two Federal offenses
 The first Federal offense is drug possession; the second 
Federal offense, drug possession, but the prosecutor is 
not quite sure that he has a strong case or she has a strong 
case for recidivism because of the first conviction
 So the -- on the second go-around, the conviction is without the added finding of recidivism
 
What does the INA do with that case? MS
 SAHARSKY: That would count as an  
Official aggravated felony, as punishable as a felony, because 
the aggravated felony language incorporates the word 
"punishable," how it could be treated under Federal law, 
not how it actually was punished
 And that's because Congress made a -- a judgment in the immigration code 
that what it wanted to do was to take all individuals 
who had been engaged in the same conduct --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you™re telling us --MS
 SAHARSKY: -- repeated drug possession, and treat them the same
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what would --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So something's not a Federal felony and it's now subject -- because he hasn't 
been convicted in Federal court of recidivism -- now 
he's being punished under the INA or removed under the 
INA for what is not a felony under Federal law? MS
 SAHARSKY: Because it's punishable --yes, because it's punishable as a felony under Federal 
law, because Congress made a judgment that those two 
drug possession offenses, the fact of recidivism makes 
it serious enough that it could be--JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I just ask you one --JUSTICE KENNEDY: If -- if I could just finish on this one -- this one
 In this hypothetical  
Official that we™re discussing, the -- the two Federal offenses 
but no finding of recidivism, does the INA have the 
authority to question the first conviction because it 
was uncounseled or in effect collaterally question the 
first conviction? MS
 SAHARSKY: It -- it's well established that those kind of challenges can't be brought in 
immigration court
 What needs to happen is they need to be brought in the State court of conviction through the 
procedures that are --JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, what -- our hypothetical here is Federal
 MS
 SAHARSKY: Oh, I'm sorry
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right
 MS
 SAHARSKY: In that case if it -- the individual would need to seek relief in Federal court in 
terms of getting his conviction --JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought if it™s in the Federal court, and the -- they are going 
to use it as a recidivist offense, (a) the defendant is 
notified of that, and (b) is given an opportunity to say 
there™s something infirm about that first conviction
 
That's totally absent from this picture
 You say, oh, well, that's just a matter of procedure, so he doesn't have to get that anyplace
  
Official I think that Congress is requiring that
 It's certainly an element of fundamental due process fairness, notice 
and opportunity to say, no, the first conviction 
shouldn't count
 MS
 SAHARSKY: With respect, we disagree because Congress made different judgments in the 
immigration context and in the criminal context
 
Immigration is very different from criminal proceedings
 
This Court has said that on numerous occasions the 
rights in terms of due process and counsel and the like 
are very different
 And in immigration, Congress made a categorical judgment that individuals who have been 
convicted of conduct should all be treated the same and 
that they all should be removed from the United States 
and should be -- not be able to get discretionary 
relief
 In the criminal sentencing context, which you are talking about, section -- the section  procedures, 
Congress made a judgment that those procedures which have 
criminal consequences and already are individualized, that 
there would be this notice provision
 But that provision Congress did not apply anywhere in the immigration laws
 
And if you look --JUSTICE BREYER: You go ahead
 MS
 SAHARSKY: I was just going to say, if  
Official you look all through the aggravated felony provisions --
they are in our brief; there are  of them -- for none 
of those provisions was Congress concerned about notice 
or the like
 It said the individual has engaged in this conduct that we think is serious
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But my point is that if it all happened in the Federal court, if these two 
possession offenses all happened in the Federal court, 
at the time of the second one the -- the defendant would 
have gotten the notice and the opportunity to knock it 
out
 I'm not talking about immigration, but just -- and he doesn't have that opportunity the way you 
treat it
 He doesn't -- didn't get that in the State court because nobody thought that this was a recidivist 
offense in the State court
 MS
 SAHARSKY: That's right
 And that's because Congress made the decision to have those types 
of notice procedures in criminal proceedings, but they 
are not applicable by their terms anywhere in the 
immigration laws
 And just to make sure that I understand the hypotheticals that you and Justice 
Kennedy have been talking about, if there is a Federal 
prosecution and the person has sought to challenge the 
validity of his conviction and it has been proven to be  
Official invalid, then in that case, yes, there would be a 
question whether that conviction could be used in the 
immigration proceedings
 There is an entire body of law that when a conviction has been vacated, it doesn't 
count as a conviction under the immigration proceedings
 So the answer is if it is a person in State court and they think that there™s a problem with their 
underlying conviction, they need to go to State court or 
use whatever procedures are available for challenging 
that
 But, again, the Court has said on numerous occasions prior convictions are presumed valid
 We do not -- we do not assume --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know practically, both on the State side and on the Federal side, do 
prosecutors presented with a simple possession case, 
do they -- do we ever see in real life this combination 
that somebody's going to be convicted as a recidivist 
when it's one marijuana cigarette on one time and one pill 
on another? Do prosecutors, Federal or State, do that? MS
 SAHARSKY: I -- I can't speak to State prosecutors
 I know there are circumstances in which Federal prosecutors do it, although, quite honestly, 
most of the Federal drug prosecutions regard the more 
serious drug crimes
 The persons that come to our attention usually can be charged with at least  
Official possession with intent to distribute or drug trafficking 
or something like that
 And when we do charge them with possession, it's usually because they pleaded down and 
we™ve agreed not to give them an enhanced sentence
 But the judgment here is the one that Congress made about whether two drug possessions is 
serious, serious enough to qualify as a felony
 And Congress --JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you a related question, which will show what I'm trying -- another 
thing that™s worrying me
 Suppose we™re in the Armed Career Criminal Act
 Now, I have -- this is my hypothetical
 You™ve heard of cat burglars
 Well, this gentleman is called the pussycat burglar, and the reason is he™s never 
harmed a soul
 He only carries soft pillows as weapons
 If he sees a child, he gives them ice cream
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE BREYER: It is absolutely established that this person in breaking into that house 
at night only wanted to steal a pop gun, and he is the 
least likely to cause harm in the world
 Question: He is convicted of burglary
 Is that a crime of violence? Answer? MS
 SAHARSKY: Well, to the extent that the  
Official burglary definition depends on the Court's modified 
categorical approach, you just look to see what he 
had been convicted of and not the individual --JUSTICE BREYER: Correct
 MS
 SAHARSKY: -- circumstances of the case
 JUSTICE BREYER: The answer is of course, because we are not looking to whether he is the pussycat 
burglar or the cat burglar
 We are to look to the statute of conviction and see what it is that that 
behavior forbids -- the statute forbids
 Lewis, Nijhawan say -- do precisely the same thing with this part 
of that long list
 Indeed, Nijhawan lists this provision as an example of what you would do the same 
thing for
 Now I'm back to my first question
 Let's do it
 Read the Texas statute
 And where in that Texas statute does it say a word about recidivism or punish 
that conduct? Now, if I adopt your position, am I not, not simply overturning Lewis and Nijhawan, but getting a 
very mixed up area of the law which we have tried to 
straighten out -- Taylor, ACCA -- once again totally 
mixed up
 That's my concern
 MS
 SAHARSKY: With respect, I think that our position is entirely consistent and, in fact,  
Official follows from Lopez and Nijhawan and is consistent with 
the Court's modified categorical approach
 So, let me just talk about Lopez and Nijhawan, because I want to make sure there's not any 
confusion about that
 Lopez said that we have a question here about whether the State offense -- and a 
State offense is made up of here drug possession; 
recidivism isn't something that you™re convicted of, 
it's a sentencing factor
 You look at the State offense and you see does it correspond to a Federal offense? Here it does
 There is State drug possession; there is Federal drug 
possession
 And then you ask another question
 And this Court said in Lopez that that's an important 
question because we care about what Congress thought, 
which is how is this offense punishable under Federal 
law
 This is a two-part inquiry where the first part, the offense elements, does need to be established 
in State court, and the second part, which goes to how 
it is punishable, does not need to be established in 
State court
 And that's exactly what the Court recognized in its opinion under Nijhawan --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under the Federal --MS
 SAHARSKY: -- albeit in a second -- 
Official JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under the Federal statute, it's only punishable on -- for recidivism purposes if the prior conviction was valid, because, as Justice Ginsburg 
pointed out, the statute permits a defendant to object
 
Who has the burden of proof of proving validity is irrelevant
 
It's not punishable as recidivism unless the prior conviction 
was valid, constitutionally valid
 So why isn't that same standard or proof thereof required either in the State conviction under 
your -- under any theory, or by the IJ? The IJ fails to make that finding, how has he and on what basis has he 
ruled that there was a valid prior conviction? MS
 SAHARSKY: What makes an offense punishable as a felony under the Federal Controlled 
Substances Act is contained in section , which 
defines the substantive punishments available
 It says that drug possession is punishable as a felony in 
certain circumstances
 And this Court in Lopez, particularly in footnote , recognized that repeat drug 
possession qualifies as punishable as a felony and under 
the CSA and --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But only under a process that requires notice --MS
 SAHARSKY: Well, this is what is interesting
 
Official JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- And --MS
 SAHARSKY: I'm sorry
 What's interesting is the Court cited for this provision 
section (a), which defines the substantive penalties 
available
 It didn't cite -- no one thought was relevant section , which defines procedures that 
happen after a conviction to impose a certain 
punishment
 So, what we™re talking about are these procedures that are necessary
 And it's not a finding of a valid conviction
 It's -- it's a long set of procedures
 There doesn't necessarily need to be a finding of a valid conviction if the defendant doesn't 
object at all
 There's burden shifting
 It's very complicated
 Congress did not apply it to the immigration code by its terms
 It's not applicable to the States by its terms
 What the Court said in Lopez in saying, in footnote , that recidivist possession counts as 
punishable under the CSA, it pointed to section , 
which defines the penalties available and not anything 
about procedures
 And even conviction --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you would suggest, then, that even if a prior State court 
conviction was secured without the advice of counsel, 
Official that would qualify as a Federal offense of recidivism
 
So let's assume this case, that in neither the 
conviction for the one marijuana stick or the conviction 
for the one sleeping pill, that if those convictions 
were secured without the advice of counsel, that would 
be enough to qualify him as a recidivist under the 
Federal law
 MS
 SAHARSKY: Well, that -- that raises a very narrow question that, so far as we are aware, has 
never been addressed in the immigration context, which 
is whether there could be a proceeding to challenge the 
narrow question of a conviction obtained in the complete 
absence of counsel
 This Court said in Custis that there -- even though there is a very broad general rule that prior 
convictions are presumed valid, that in one narrow 
situation, the complete absence of counsel, that a due 
process type challenge could be brought
 Now, that question has never been raised in this case, whether such a challenge could be brought in 
immigration proceedings despite the general rule that 
there are no such collateral challenges, but that is a 
different rule and a different body of jurisprudence 
from this Court, the due process body, as opposed to 
importing all of the very complicated section   
Official procedures into the -- the -- the inquiry here
 And just to get back to the --JUSTICE ALITO: Could a -- could a defendant whose prior conviction was under a State recidivism 
statute claim that that conviction was invalid because 
that defendant was at that time deprived of the right of 
counsel? Do you see a difference between that situation and the situation in which -- and the situation in the 
sort of case we have here with respect to the issue of 
whether the prior conviction was invalid because of the 
deprivation of the right of counsel? MR
 SRINIVASAN: Yes, I think that they™re potentially distinguishable
 But, you know, this is --this is not a question that has ever come up in the 
immigration context
 It would be a special rule that would be based on the Court's decision, we think, in 
Custis and not anything about ﬁpunishableﬂ referring to 
section  procedures
 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why are they distinguishable? You could -- you can -- you could -- a person faced with removal could challenge 
a prior conviction on the ground that there was a 
deprivation of the right of counsel, whether or not it 
was pursuant to a recidivism -- whether or not there was 
a recidivism issue in it, couldn't -- couldn't they?  
Official MS
 SAHARSKY: Yes, but I think recidivism -- I think there™s some confusion in the 
Court's discussion, perhaps, that recidivism is not an 
element of the offense
 You™re never convicted of recidivism
 You™re convicted of an offense, and you might be subject to an increased punishment for that 
offense because you are a recidivist
 And that's essentially what Petitioner wants here, is to define the State court offense as having an 
element of recidivism, but there is one thing that™s 
clear from this Court's jurisprudence to this point is 
that recidivism is separate and unique from anything 
else that might --JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what case do I read to establish that? MS
 SAHARSKY: That recidivism is separate and unique? JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right
 MS
 SAHARSKY: Almendarez-Torres would be one
 The Court's decision in Rodriquez would be another
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but Almendarez-Torres was a different offense; was it not? 
I mean this is -- this is a drug offender who -- it's 
not like a burglar who stops burglary to take up a new 
Official trade
 This is -- this is a drug offender who continues to repeat under the drug offense laws, and I thought the 
position was that this shows a particular propensity, a 
particular immoral attitude that™s not being corrected
 
And so that the recidivism makes him a worse person
 MS
 SAHARSKY: Well, what this Court said in Rodriguez generally about recidivist punishments is you™re 
always being punished for the last offense, but 
you're being punished more severely because it™s shown 
that incapacitation and deterrence isn't working for 
you
 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what was worrying me, that's why I asked the other question
 But the --what was worrying me would be a statute where they --
it's big enough in the State to cover possession with 
recidivism or not, and they deal with it at the 
punishment stage, and I can see your point in respect to 
that
 But that isn't this statute
 This statute not only doesn't deal with it at the punishment stage; it's forbidden to take it into 
account because what this says is you can only get 
recidivism if you previously had a conviction for a 
class A misdemeanor, and the prior conviction here was a 
class B; and, therefore, one thing we know about the 
statute is that under this statute, his behavior as a  
Official recidivist is as close to irrelevant as you could make 
it
 That's why I™m back to the cat burglar
 MS
 SAHARSKY: Right
 And what -- what I'm suggesting about that State statute is that -- and this 
Court said this in Lopez -- that Congress didn't want 
those variations in State law to change the treatment 
for individual offenders
 What it wanted, and it did this in aggravated felony provisions, all throughout them, is to 
identify categories of persons who had done certain 
conduct that Congress thought was serious enough and 
treat them all the same for immigration purposes
 And the Court said in Lopez, we™re not going to make the 
way that State law treats recidivism -- or we're not 
going to make State law treats an offense change the 
outcome
 The outcome is going to be based on how Federal law treats the offense
 And that's why, to get back to one of my earlier answers to your questions, we think that this 
Court's decision in Nijhawan is extremely important 
here, because what the Court recognized in that decision 
is that Congress, in defining an aggravated felony, 
sometimes talks about required elements of the offense, 
and it sometimes talks about extra facts that can be 
established in the immigration court
 In Nijhawan, there  
Official was a fraud or deceit offense with this extra fact of 
this loss amount of $, or more
 And Congress did the same thing in this provision
 They had --JUSTICE BREYER: It did? Well, Nijhawan uses this provision as an example of where it didn't
 MS
 SAHARSKY: Well, we think that that refers to the first part of the definition
 There are actually two parts of the definition
 This is I think on page -- right at the beginning of the appendix to our 
brief
 If you look at page a of the gray brief
 You know, there are two different parts here
 In (B), there is ﬁillicit trafficking in a controlled substance – including a drug trafficking crime 
(as defined in section (c))
ﬂ So this -- this first part, illicit trafficking, is like a generic burglary 
type offense where you need to just look at whether 
the -- essentially elements correspond under a modified 
categorical approach
 But then the second part of it, the drug trafficking crime, is the one that's defined as a felony 
punishable under the Controlled Substances Act
 And when you look at a felony punishable under the Controlled 
Substances Act, which this Court interpreted in Lopez as 
a -- an offense that is punishable as a felony under Federal 
law, it is just like Nijhawan
 It is an offense with  
Official a certain extra fact
 In Nijhawan, it was a fraud --JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you --MS
 SAHARSKY: -- and deceit offense
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- because your time is running out
 I take it your answer would be the same -- at least these two misdemeanors were 
committed a year apart, but if they were  years apart, 
your answer would still be the same? MS
 SAHARSKY: Yes, and I think that™s because Congress has said when it wants the -- the 
timing to matter
 For example, in the end of the aggravated felony definitions, Congress said it didn't 
want felony convictions that were more than  years old 
to matter
 You know, Congress -- when it wants something old not to matter, it says so, an older conviction
 So we don't think that there would be a difference for that 
purpose
 So I just want to make sure I™ve answered the question
 We just think this is like that situation where you have a conviction for a certain type of 
offense, which here is drug possession, and an extra fact, 
how it™s punishable in Federal court, and that extra 
fact can be established in immigration court
 It's not the kind thing that this Court has said under 
Almendarez-Torres needs to be treated like an offense  
Official element
 I should note that --- and this is the point you made, Justice Breyer, that there was not a 
recidivist enhancement available in Texas court
 
Justice Kennedy, that just highlights some of the 
problems that you identified in terms of the wide 
variations that we would see in how similarly situated 
people who have done the same things, two drug possession 
offenses, would be treated differently under the 
immigration laws
 And that's just not what Congress intended
 We talk in our brief -- and there™s a long list of differences in State laws, not only in the 
State procedures, which vary widely from Federal court, 
but in the State laws in terms of, you know, if you can 
consider a second possession offense for recidivist 
enhancement, or only a third or fourth; whether the 
first offense has to be final, et cetera, et cetera, 
et cetera
 That there -- these differences would just lead to a -- a patchwork application laws of the 
immigration laws, and if there™s any place where we don't 
want that, it's -- it's in immigration, with respect to 
immigration consequences
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was another crime, I thought a more serious crime, though still a  
Official misdemeanor, in this picture, but the Texas prosecutor 
didn't make anything of that
 Remind me of what that was, but I thought it was a -- a more grave offense
 MS
 SAHARSKY: You might be thinking of his prior offense for domestic violence
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes
 MS
 SAHARSKY: That that may have been able to be used to -- to enhance his -- his drug crime to an 
enhanced sentence, but that -- there wasn't an 
enhancement sought on that
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes --MS
 SAHARSKY: That was a -- a  conviction
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So we respect that judgment on the part of the prosecutor, not to make it a 
-- a ground for a recidivist charge, but we don't 
respect the prosecutor -- Texas prosecutor saying I'm 
just going to treat this like it's a first-time 
misdemeanor; that's it
 MS
 SAHARSKY: In neither case does the prosecutor's judgment matter
 What matters is the offense conduct that was established by the conviction 
in State court
 What matters is the offense that the person was convicted of and if that corresponds to a 
Federal offense that was punishable as a felony in  
Official Federal court
 It is true that some charges may be brought and some charges may not be brought, and that 
would impact what a person has been convicted of
 So there could be disparities based on that
 But what Congress decided was that it had to balance its need for 
uniformity with a rule that is administrable, and the rule 
that it picked as administrable is, let's look at the 
offense conduct that was established by the conviction
 
And when you look at that offense conduct, you have to ask 
how it could be punished in Federal court
 And it's that ﬁpunishableﬂ language that requires this more hypothetical 
inquiry on how the events -- how the offense could be 
treated
 And just to summarize, it is clear from the last  years that Congress has had a very serious 
concern about recidivist criminal aliens in the United 
States, and Congress has made a judgment since  in 
the drug laws that two drug possession offenses should 
be punishable as a felony
 And under those circumstances, a person who concededly has committed 
those two drug offenses and who concededly, if taken to 
Federal court, could have been punished as a felony, just 
should not be able to escape the aggravated felony 
designation that Congress intended for all aliens who  
Official are similarly situated
 If the Court has no further questions, we submit the judgment below should be affirmed
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms
 Saharsky
 Mr
 Srinivasan, you have  minutes remaining
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR
 SRINIVASAN: Thank you --JUSTICE KENNEDY: We usually think of recidivism when we talk about statistics as being 
repeated for any crime
 This is a recidivism of a special kind
 It's repeating the same -- the same thing
 Is that essential to your argument? I know it's essential to the -- to the Federal statute
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: Right, and because it's essential to the Federal statute, it's necessarily a part 
of our argument
 I don't think our argument would be any different if the Federal statute read differently, 
but you can only be punishable as a felon under Federal 
law if you had a prior drug conviction, and if you had a 
prior drug conviction that was in fact found to exist
 And I think, Justice Kennedy, the first point I™d like to make in rebuttal -- there's two points I™d  
Official like to make
 The first addresses a question you raised concerning what happens in a situation in which the second proceeding is a Federal proceeding rather 
than a State proceeding
 And I think this is important to highlight the government's response, because if the second proceeding 
is a Federal proceeding, we have a person who has a prior 
conviction for drug possession
 We have a person who is then prosecuted in Federal court for a second time for 
drug possession
 The prosecutor by hypothesis never brings the initial conviction into play
 The court therefore never finds that the person is a recidivist
 
As a consequence, that person cannot as a matter of law 
receive a felony sentence
 They can only be sentenced as a misdemeanant
 But nonetheless, the government would say that they have been, quote, "convicted of a felony, 
punishable under the Controlled Substances Act," close quote --JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you --MR
 SRINIVASAN: -- even though no felony sentence could be imposed
 JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you distinguish Nijhawan? I mean, there what made it a Federal felony was the fact that more than $, was obtained from 
the victims
 But that was not found in the -- in the State conviction
 It simply was not
  
Official MR
 SRINIVASAN: There were -- there were two things that made it a Federal felony, 
Justice Scalia
 First was it had to be an offense that involved fraud
 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: And then -- and that had to be found by the convicting court
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: There was no issue about that
 Our --JUSTICE SCALIA: No issue
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: Our point is that --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what about the $,? That --MR
 SRINIVASAN: That™s the --JUSTICE SCALIA: He was never convicted of having obtained by fraud more than $, from the 
victim
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: But -- but there's a very important textual distinction, Justice Scalia, because 
under the provision at issue in Nijhawan, the offense 
had to involve fraud, and then there was a separator in 
which the loss exceeds $,
 And the Court focused on the fact that the text read "in which
" That was critical, and another thing that was critical in 
Official Nijhawan was that if you looked at Federal statutes and asked, were there any that as to which the elements would 
require a loss in excess of $,, there were none
 And because of that practical consequence, the Court reached the conclusion that Congress would 
have intended, that the $, be something that the 
immigration judge could have found
 We have the opposite situation here
 JUSTICE SCALIA: You still had the word "convicted
" MR
 SRINIVASAN: You had -- sure
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is what you™re relying on
 That word was applicable there as much as it™s applicable here, and we did not require him to 
have been convicted of having obtained more than $,
 MR
 SRINIVASAN: Because, again, the test --the text also had "in which," which the Court found 
critical -- that text is lacking here -- and because the 
statute would have had no practical consequence, absent 
the Court's interpretation
 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that™s -- that --MR
 SRINIVASAN: That's not true here
 JUSTICE BREYER: Because she got to that argument at the end, and she said my -- I wrote that, I think, and I --
when I used as an example or the text uses an example, this  
Official it would be abdicating its duty under 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't say that
 It just wouldn't do it
 That's all
 MS
 FREELAND: You™re right, Your Honor
 It just wouldn't do that, but history would speak for 
itself
 The Commission has constantly undertaken this duty under (o)
 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it™s certainly a factor that if I were -- if I were on the Commission, I 
would certainly take that factor into account
 Every time I make it retroactive, it™s going to reopen --
going to reopen the whole sentencing and -- and allow 
a Booker application where -- where it didn't apply 
before
 How can I close my eyes to that if --MS
 FREELAND: Well, Your Honor --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if I™m making the retroactivity determination? MS
 FREELAND: Your Honor, if I could, I™m not suggesting that the Commission close its eyes to 
anything
 However, what we™re asking for in this case is not a full resentencing where all sentencing 
decisions would be reopened
 We™re simply saying that when a court imposes a new sentence, that new sentence 
must comply with this Court's decision in Booker, and --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Only Booker?  
Official JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that means it --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Only Booker? What if there is another constitutional objection 
to the sentence, and he goes back under --
under the crack cocaine? Can you say, oh, and, you know, also, it violated my rights under equal 
protection? You didn't notice that before, but here's the argument
 Is that before the sentencing court? MS
 FREELAND: Your Honor, I would have to say that it is
 The -- the new sentence --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, you would you have to say
 So --MS
 FREELAND: The sentence imposed would have to comply with the Constitution
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's not only as unfair as Justice Ginsburg hypothesized
 It's even more unfair than that, because just because of the crack 
cocaine change, somebody with an equal protection 
challenge gets to raise that
 While somebody in prison without an equal -- with an equal protection challenge 
but not the crack cocaine one is still stuck
 MS
 FREELAND: That's true, Mr
 Chief Justice, but that's the case in any situation 
where a defendant has raised an issue on appeal or has 
presented a claim in a  petition, and just by 
Official happenstance the decision awarding them a new -- a new 
trial or a new sentence happens when a new 
constitutional rule is announced by this Court
 
Now, certain --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's a new constitutional rule
 This is an old one
 This is one that was -- you know, the equal protection clause has 
been in the books for a while
 And -- and he -- he just gets the chance to raise it solely because of the fact 
that his conviction involved crack cocaine
 MS
 FREELAND: And, again, Your Honor, I think that he would get to raise it, but I want to point 
out that not every constitutional issue would be ripe 
for the court's decision at that proceeding
 If there were an opportunity to raise -- as you said, equal 
protection isn™t a new law like -- we™re talking about 
Booker being a new law for Mr
 -- for Mr
 Dillon
 If there were an equal protection challenge that had not 
been lodged at the original sentencing, the district 
court would apply the law of the case and then --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, no, no
 I thought under your theory this is a whole new 
sentencing
 So who cares whether he waived it at the first one? We™re starting from -- from point zero
 MS
 FREELAND: Mr
 Chief Justice, I must  
Official have misspoken
 That is certainly not what I meant to indicate
 What I meant to say is, certainly, all sentences imposed ought to comply with the Constitution, 
but we live in a system that has waiver principles, law 
of the case, mandate rule
 These are all obstacles that a defendant seeking to overturn a sentencing or raise an 
issue on equal protection grounds that weren't presented 
before would serve as obstacles to their doing so
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And my point is that they shouldn't under your theory
 The fact that he waived it at the earlier sentencing under your theory 
should not matter at all, because your theory is that 
this is a whole new sentencing, so who cares what went 
on in the prior sentencing? MS
 FREELAND: I disagree, Your Honor, that my theory does not encompass that part of the rule
 And I think with respect to our criminal history issue that 
we™ve raised that™s precisely what we™ve said, that 
there are errors that a district court may not be able 
to correct in a (c) proceeding --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why do you -- why do you pick on -- on Booker as -- as not carrying over? I mean, if you say that there carries over from the prior 
sentencing his failure to raise the equal protection 
claim, why can't you say it's also law of the case that  
Official the Booker objection doesn't stand? It's law of the case
 It was decided before Booker, and that's the law of the 
case as far as that's concerned
 MS
 FREELAND: Well, Your Honor, if the law of the case were in place before Booker were decided, the 
new law would be an exception to the law of the case if 
Mr
 Dillon were resentenced as he were after the Court's 
decision in Booker
 I'm not sure if that answers your question precisely
 For Mr
 Dillon, Booker is new law at his new sentencing
 He did not have an opportunity to raise a Booker objection or ask for a sentence below the 
guideline range at his original sentencing
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under your theory, there™s no bar to an upward sentence by the -- by the 
judge, because if it's a brand new hearing subject to 
Booker, which mandates complete discretion under , 
the judges define the sentence that fits the crime and 
the defendant
 So you don't mind an upward --MS
 FREELAND: Well, under (c), Your Honor, statute -- the statute provides that it --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know you want --MS
 FREELAND: -- a sentence be only reduced JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You only want part of -- the statute, not the whole statute?  
Official MS
 FREELAND: Your Honor, I think we want the whole statute, the statute that allows --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you want the whole statute, then it's a new sentence
 You can't beg and say the statute limits up and down, but I only want the down --MS
 FREELAND: Your Honor --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and I want a new sentence
 It doesn't make sense
 MS
 FREELAND: I think I understand your point
 The -- the problem is with the statute
 (c) does not authorize a court to increase the sentence
 The fact that a sentence cannot be increased does not divest the proceeding at which it™s imposed --JUSTICE BREYER: So what's -- what's the --the words in the statute is that it may reduce the term
 
You can™t change the term -- you cannot change a 
sentence, except that you can reduce the term if such 
reduction is consistent with applicable policy 
statements
 MS
 FREELAND: That's correct, Your Honor
 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you see anything --what's -- what's unconstitutional about that? Then they issue a policy statement, and the policy statement says 
you can't reduce it except insofar as our new --
Official whatever the new thing is -- applies
 If you™re arguing that that violates the Constitution, what I™m missing is why? What violates the Constitution in that? MS
 FREELAND: Your Honor, post-Booker, what violates the Constitution is the policy statement's use 
of the word "shall
" That's a -- that's a significant change --JUSTICE BREYER: I don't remember --MS
 FREELAND: -- in the wording of 
 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought in Booker --and I have to go back and look at it, but I thought in 
Booker the Court held that certain specific -- like 
certain specific words in certain specific provisions 
of the -- the sentencing statutes were unconstitutional 
because of Apprendi and because of the other part, 
Booker itself
 Well,  wasn't one of them
 So -- so there must be something unconstitutional if you™re 
right
 I don't see how you get around this statute
 MS
 FREELAND: Your Honor, in our view (c) is not unconstitutional
 It --JUSTICE BREYER: All right
 If it's not unconstitutional, then why don't you have to follow it? 
Because what it says is, you cannot get a reduction  
Official except in respect to what the policy guideline says
 
And the policy guideline says you don't get a reduction, 
except insofar as we™ve reduced a sentence in a 
particular respect
 What's unconstitutional about that? I'm --I'm not saying there isn't
 I want to know what your argument is that it is unconstitutional
 MS
 FREELAND: Justice Breyer, post-Booker, if (c) is interpreted as you just said, that the 
sentence -- the reduction in sentence must be consistent 
with applicable policy statements absolutely --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's what it says
 I don't know how you™d interpret it some other way --MS
 FREELAND: And that the --JUSTICE BREYER: -- if that's what it says
 MS
 FREELAND: And that the policy statement then requires the court to impose a mandatory guideline 
sentence --JUSTICE BREYER: No, it just says what we're doing is we™re reopening the sentencing in respect to 
the particular way we reduce people's sentence, not in 
respect to something else
 That's what I read the policy statement to say
 That if there were  things that were considered in the sentence and one of those  
is changed in a downward direction, then it says we make  
Official an exception, says the policy statement
 You can reopen number , but not the first 
 Now, why is that unconstitutional? What in the Constitution prohibits doing that? MS
 FREELAND: The -- Your Honor, if I could, the constitutional problem with section B
(b)()(A) 
is that it requires the district court to impose a 
sentence within the guideline range
 Therein lies the problem
 The requirement, a mandatory guideline sentence based on a judicially enhanced range --
therein lies the problem
 Section (c) does not mandate guideline sentencing
 It's B

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms
 Freeland, what would happen if the -- the motion is made with respect to the 
crack cocaine, and the judge said, I'm -- I'm not going 
to -- I deny the motion? Would the judge then have to go on and consider Booker and say, now, on this piece, 
I deny the motion, but now I can just do whatever I want 
with the rest of it? MS
 FREELAND: Your Honor, if I could, if a judge is presented with a (c) motion and denies the 
motion, all the court has done is enter an order denying 
a motion
 It's not until the district court decides to  
Official grant the (c) motion and reduce the defendant's 
sentence that (a) factors come into play, the policy 
statements come into play, and a new sentence is 
thereafter imposed
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if -- suppose Congress and the Sentencing Commission had made it 
crystal clear that they are authorizing a reopening but 
only with respect to one piece
 You say -- you say no matter how clear it is, as a matter of constitutional 
law, because Booker has been decided, the whole sentence 
is up for --MS
 FREELAND: Justice Ginsburg --JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- consideration? MS
 FREELAND: Justice Ginsburg, that™s correct
 And the reason is because (c) is a provision that is used by courts to correct sentences
 
Once the court decides that the defendant is worthy of a 
correction, that the sentence should be corrected, it 
grants a motion extinguishing the old sentence and 
imposes a new sentence
 Our position is simply that when it imposes the new sentence, it must comply with Booker's 
constitutional and remedial holdings
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I have a better answer to Justice Breyer's question
 You want my better answer?  
Official MS
 FREELAND: Please, Justice Scalia
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure
 (Laughter
) JUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's -- it's not --it's not section  that™s unconstitutional, and it 
isn't even the provision for being guided by a policy 
statement of the Sentencing Commission that's 
unconstitutional
 It is the nature of the Sentencing Commission's policy statement that is unconstitutional
 Surely, if the Sentencing Commission had a policy statement which said you will reduce it for white 
prisoners but not for black prisoners, that would surely 
be unconstitutional, right? MS
 FREELAND: Absolutely, Your Honor
 JUSTICE SCALIA: And your point here is that the policy statement which says you effectively will 
disregard Booker is unconstitutional? MS
 FREELAND: I agree
 JUSTICE SCALIA: That works, doesn't it? MS
 FREELAND: I agree
 And, Justice Breyer --JUSTICE BREYER: You agree
 Now -- now, what -- that's what I -- I could understand that if  
said to the judge you resentence him
 But it doesn't say that
 So there™s a sentence in effect, and what 
Official  says is a -- a sentence can be reduced just as if, 
to go back to the beginning, Congress passed a statute 
or the Commission said everybody's sentence will be 
reduced
 That doesn't change what the sentence was
 It says there™s a reduction, like for good -- good time
 So it says a defendant, if he has been sentenced based on factor  in the case, the court may 
reduce the term of imprisonment, the term of 
imprisonment there under the sentence
 So I'm back to my question
 What™s unconstitutional about that? MS
 FREELAND: Justice --JUSTICE BREYER: And what the court just says is the court -- the Commission says: That's right
 You may reduce it in respect to what we™ve considered; you 
may not reduce it in respect to something which is 
not considered
 So I'm still puzzled about the constitutional problem
 MS
 FREELAND: And, Justice Breyer, I apologize because I may not be --JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, you don't have to apologize
 MS
 FREELAND: -- I may not be understanding your question
  
Official JUSTICE BREYER: I understand your argument now
 And I didn't quite and now I do
 So there™s nothing to apologize for
 MS
 FREELAND: Okay
 I™d like to --JUSTICE BREYER: You wanted to get the idea in my mind
 I'm not expressing that in my question, but I got your answer
 MS
 FREELAND: Okay, thank you
 (Laughter
) MS
 FREELAND: A couple of points, though, that I -- that -- from reading the text of the statute 
that I™d like to point out
 Justice Breyer, notice it doesn't say "sentence
" It says "term of imprisonment
" "Term of imprisonment" is -- is a term of art in the Federal Code
 A "term of imprisonment" is an authorized sentence under  of the United 
States Code
 And under , the Bureau of Prisons cannot hold someone in custody absent a sentence of 
imprisonment
 And in this case, there are two judgments, two sentences of imprisonment
 The Bureau of Prisons would not have been able to hold Mr
 Dillon for 
 months under the  judgment, and the Bureau of 
Prisons certainly cannot hold Mr
 Dillon for  months 
under the --
Official CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry
 Why --MS
 FREELAND: -- the June  judgment
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why could they --the first part of that, why could they not hold him for 
the term under the  sentence? MS
 FREELAND: Under , it's very clear that the -- the Bureau of Prisons, absent a reduction 
under (b) for good time, is directed to hold the 
defendant in the custody of Bureau of Prisons for the 
term of imprisonment on the judgment
 In this case, following the --JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what if the President reduces the sentence using his pardon 
power? He cuts it back; he cuts it in half
 The Bureau of Prisons has to hold him for the full term of the 
imprisonment? No, that can't be true
 MS
 FREELAND: Justice Scalia, I'm certain that that's not true
 And I mean, there -- I™m not familiar --JUSTICE SCALIA: So why is this any different? MS
 FREELAND: -- with those provisions
 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is this any different? I mean, there are obviously -- what it proves is that 
there are exceptions to that requirement that they hold 
Official him for the term of imprisonment
 They -- they have to hold him for the term of imprisonment unless it has been 
shortened, right, by -- by pardon or remission of part 
of the term by the President or what the argument for 
the government is, or by application of this retroactive 
rule by -- by the Commission
 MS
 FREELAND: And again, Your Honor, I'm not familiar with the clemency and commutation 
procedures
 I would have to think that some piece of paper, some order directing the Bureau of Prisons to 
reduce the sentence, just as a new judgment in a (c) 
is a new sentence of  months, would have to be 
presented so that the Bureau of Prisons would release
 But -- but that aside, the -- the real point here is that the new judgment is a new judgment; it is a 
new sentence
 This is not a reduction in the old sentence
 It --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that™s what it says
 It™s -- the other thing that has bothered me, to tell you 
the truth, is -- is the part of the point that was brought 
up previously, that it is up to the Commission whether to 
make it retroactive
 It is
 MS
 FREELAND: I agree
 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know why they couldn't take into account that to make any drug-related  
Official change, you see, and then make that retroactive, is 
going to reopen the sentencing for every single person 
who has already been convicted of a drug crime in the 
Federal courts, of which there are probably tens of 
thousands
 And -- and I think they would properly take that into account
 And, therefore, they might properly say, we're not going to make this retroactive
 MS
 FREELAND: Your Honor, the -- the practice in the court of appeals post-Booker of 
remanding all of the cases that were in the pipeline 
shows that the Federal courts are able to handle 
revisiting thousands of sentences imposed under a 
mandatory system to revisit them under (a)
 And as Justice Walton said in testifying before the Sentencing 
Commission with respect to this issue, that the courts 
are fully prepared to handle any administrative burden 
and believes that such a burden would be sufficiently 
justified for people like Mr
 Dillon who are deserving
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I™ll make this brief because your -- your rebuttal light is on
 Your answer made sense when we talk about term as opposed to 
sentence, if you just look at (c)
 But (b) says, ﬁNotwithstanding the fact that a sentence to imprisonment 
can be modified – a judgment of conviction that  
Official includes such a sentence constitutes a final judgment
ﬂ 
Does (b) not apply to (c)? MS
 FREELAND: (b) does apply to (c), Your Honor, and I'm glad that you raised that because (b) 
is significant in that it does not distinguish the 
effect of finality of remands, modifications under 
(c); it's the judgment of conviction -- the 
conviction that remains final
 The sentence is no longer final if modified under any of the provisions 
listed in (b)
 If there are no further questions, I™d like to reserve the remainder of my time
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms
 Freeland

 Kruger
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R
 KRUGER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MS
 KRUGER: Mr
 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act at issue in this case, unlike the provisions that were 
at issue in Booker, do not govern the imposition of 
sentence
 They instead provide a discretionary mechanism for the exercise of leniency for defendants 
who have already been sentenced
 The district court in  
Official this case properly exercised its authority under the 
statute to reduce Petitioner's sentence by a little bit 
more than  years, which was the maximum amount of 
reduction that was consistent with the Sentencing 
Commission's specification under section (u) about 
whether and to what extent its crack cocaine amendments 
warranted reductions in already imposed sentences
 The district court had neither a further obligation nor indeed the authority to set Petitioner's 
sentence aside altogether and resentence Petitioner 
under the advisory guidelines regime announced in 
Booker
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that extend to --which was part of this case -- the court notices that 
there was a technical error; it was a calculation error 
the first time, and the judge says, well, I™ll fix 
that up, too
 That was an arithmetic error
 MS
 KRUGER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the same rule applies to the calculation error that Petitioner is 
raising
 Section (c)() wasn™t designed by Congress to serve as effectively a less restrictive 
substitute for raising such challenges on direct appeal 
or where otherwise available under section 
 It was instead designed for the limited purpose of providing an  
Official opportunity to extend leniency to defendants whose 
sentences are otherwise final, nonappealable, and 
therefore not subject to any modification
 Justice Sotomayor, you had asked earlier whether this provision was designed as an act of 
clemency or was instead designed as a kind of adjunct to 
the court's judicial review power, a kind of -type 
power
 We think the answer is clearly that it was designed as a mechanism for the exercise of a type of 
clemency power
 I think that™s particularly clear if you look at the parallel provisions in section 
(c)(), which are reprinted at pages a and a of the 
appendix to the government's brief
 Those provisions also provide for similar types of sentence reductions in cases where the director 
of the Bureau of Prisons makes a motion for sentence 
reduction based either on extraordinary and compelling 
reasons or because the defendant is over the age of  
and has served more than  years in prison
 In all of these cases, the district court exercises a discretionary power to reduce the sentence 
in the exercise of leniency, not because of legal error 
but for equitable reasons
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that gets tied up, doesn't it, to your argument that this is not a part of  
Official the criminal prosecution, that this is a -- not a Sixth 
Amendment proceeding, but -- not a Sixth Amendment 
proceeding, so it doesn't require constitutional 
protection? MS
 KRUGER: That's correct, Justice Sotomayor
 We think that what Congress has called for in all of the sentence reduction provisions of section 
(c) is a kind of discretionary mechanism for 
reducing sentences that are already final and 
nonappealable and can't be modified in any other respect
 
It hasn't called for a de novo plenary resentencing so 
to allow defendants in the position that Petitioner is 
in to come into court and reopen every aspect of their 
sentence, requiring reconsideration of guidelines 
determinations made in this case more than a decade ago 
or requiring application of intervening changes in the 
law
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct in understanding that (c) was enacted prior to our 
decision in Booker? MS
 KRUGER: Yes, it -- it was
 JUSTICE STEVENS: And is it clear that it should be construed as though the system was mandatory 
before the decision in Booker, rather than construed in 
the light of the remedial decision in Booker?  
Official MS
 KRUGER: Well, I think there are two questions that are raised here about how this statutory 
scheme comports with Booker
 One is the Sixth Amendment question, whether this is a statutory provision that 
calls for a resentencing, at which Booker and its 
decision about the Sixth Amendment would apply
 And then the second question is even if you think there is no constitutional problem with reading 
the statute in accordance with its plain terms, whether 
Booker's remedial analysis requires treating the 
reference to the policy statements in section (c)() 
as purely advisory
 We think with respect to that question, not even Petitioner is quite willing to embrace the full 
consequences of that argument
 It would mean severing and excising the portion of (c)() that requires 
consistency with the applicable policy statements
 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right
 Is that any more a dramatic change than was made in the Booker remedial 
opinion itself? MS
 KRUGER: I'm not sure whether or not it's a more dramatic change in terms of the number of 
cases that would be affected, but it™s --JUSTICE STEVENS: But the remedial opinion basically rewrote the whole statute on -- except first 
Official it didn't have to reach (c), but it certainly 
changed the -- the nature of the mandatory provisions 
that were previously in the statute
 MS
 KRUGER: That's true, and it did so in order to solve the constitutional difficulties that were 
created by a mandatory guidelines system with respect to 
the imposition of sentence
 Without that same kind of Sixth Amendment violation in the context of discretionary sentence 
reduction proceedings, we think there is no basis in 
Booker's analysis for severing and excising any portion 
of (c)(), but I would note that the consequence of 
severing and excising the requirement of consistency with 
the applicable policy statements would be to free 
district courts not only from the Sentencing 
Commission's specifications about how much to reduce 
sentences, but also which of its amendments to the 
guidelines would justify retroactive application, 
because it is after all in a policy statement, section 
B
, that the Sentencing Commission has specified 
which of its amendments, among many, justify sentence 
reductions under (c)()
 That would mean that every time the Sentencing Commission revises its guidelines 
and reduces applicable sentencing ranges, any number of 
defendants would be free to come to the district courts  
Official and ask them to make their own independent judgment 
about whether or not they should be effectively 
resentenced as a consequence
 And that would certainly provide a significant disincentive for the Sentencing 
Commission ever to revise sentencing guidelines in a 
downward direction
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have there been other guidelines ranges that have been reduced, and, if so, 
were those also retroactive? MS
 KRUGER: There have -- there have been many guidelines ranges that have been reduced over the 
course of the existence of the sentencing guidelines
 I believe that right now, the current number of -- of 
guidelines amendments the Sentencing Commission has made 
retroactive stands at 
 This was the -- one of the first decisions that the Sentencing Commission made about retroactivity 
in the wake of Booker, and it did so with full 
consciousness of the potential for broadly reopening 
sentences
 And it certainly weighed very heavily in the Sentencing Commission's deliberations that the 
traditional understanding, existing long before Booker 
was ever decided, was that (c)() proceedings do not 
constitute plenary resentencings that incorporate all 
intervening changes to the law
  
Official JUSTICE BREYER: Can -- can I ask you a different question on the secondary argument that they 
make? When I read the secondary argument, that there was an error in the calculation of the guidelines and 
she would like to have that error corrected, I didn't 
see anything in the policy statement that would prevent 
her from getting that correction
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think you told me -- I asked you that question, and you told me it could not be 
corrected, because everything was final
 MS
 KRUGER: That's correct --JUSTICE BREYER: But why? MS
 KRUGER: -- and the policy statement actually also --JUSTICE BREYER: What in the policy statement? Because what it says is: What you're supposed to do is: Judge, you go and look at the guidelines that were applied
 Now, substitute the new one reducing the sentence for the old one, and 
then go apply it
 And, therefore, that seems to me not to block a claim that would say, when you apply these 
guidelines with the new one substituted for the old one, 
apply them; that is, if, in fact, there was an error 
the first time
 
Official Now, she may have a hard time showing that, but if she can show it, what in the words that are right there in (b)() stops her from getting that correction? MS
 KRUGER: It's on page -- if you look at page a of the appendix --JUSTICE BREYER: I have it
 MS
 KRUGER: -- in the government™s brief --JUSTICE BREYER: I have it in front of me
 MS
 KRUGER: In the final sentence, it says, ﬁIn making such determination, the court shall 
substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c)ﬂ --JUSTICE BREYER: That™s right
 MS
 KRUGER: -- ﬁfor the corresponding provisions that were appliedﬂ ---JUSTICE BREYER: That™s right
 MS
 KRUGER: -- ﬁand shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected
ﬂ JUSTICE BREYER: Well, all other guideline application decisions, and the claim is that they just 
made an error, like a clerical error, a clear error, 
manifest injustice, in that first math
 Do you think that this would leave them unaffected? MS
 KRUGER: I do
 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes
 I see
 MS
 KRUGER: I think that that is the plain 
Official meaning of the Sentencing Commission's directive there
 
I would say that the question --JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess they also made a mistake in not applying Booker, right? (Laughter
) MS
 KRUGER: Well, the premise of that question, I think, assumes two things
 It assumes that (c)() proceedings are plenary sentencings at which 
Booker applies, which the Sentencing Commission, based 
on a very long history of rejections and precisely 
that parameter
 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no
 I would have thought the objection to that is: No, they didn't make a mistake in applying Booker, because this Court has said that Booker 
isn't retroactive
 MS
 KRUGER: Well --JUSTICE BREYER: And, of course, they did make a mistake if it is retroactive
 And then the Court should have said it is retroactive, in which case there would 
be no problem
 MS
 KRUGER: Well, if Booker were retroactive, I think that our position would still be 
that this is not the proper vehicle for applying it, 
that the proper vehicle would be to file a motion for --
to vacate or set aside the sentence under section 
  
Official Congress didn't intend these sentence reduction proceedings to serve essentially the same 
purpose
 It -- it intended them to serve simply the purpose of reducing otherwise final, nonappealable 
sentences
 I would say --JUSTICE BREYER: I know my word was: It shall leave all other guideline application decisions
 
Well, that's -- that's -- their claim is not that the 
guideline -- it's that they -- they chose the wrong 
guideline or they didn't apply the right words
 You see, so they weren't applying that -- they just applied 
the wrong thing
 Now you say I'm working too hard
 Okay
 MS
 KRUGER: I think you may be working a little hard, Justice Breyer
 (Laughter
) MS
 KRUGER: I would say that, on that point, we also fundamentally disagree with Petitioner's 
submission that there was any error in the calculation 
of his criminal history score in 
 But to the extent that Petitioner wanted to raise any challenges to that determination, we think the 
appropriate time and place to do that would have been on 
direct appeal of that sentencing decision, rather than 
waiting a decade and attempting to use the (c)() 
Official proceedings as a kind of vehicle for collaterally 
reopening that aspect of his sentence
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: When the judge considers the adjustment motion under the -- under the section, 
does he consider how the prisoner has behaved in prison; 
i
e
, if he has behaved very badly, he doesn't give 
the -- the reduction? MS
 KRUGER: The district court can consider any disciplinary proceedings that have occurred in the 
course of the defendant's imprisonment, yes
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But he -- but he can™t go below
 The -- the Petitioner makes the argument metaphysically that there™s just a new sentence
 In your view, is that refuted by the language of (c)() 
because they talk about in the case of a defendant who 
has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and then 
they say the term can be reduced, and it doesn't use the 
words "a new sentence shall be imposed"? I assume that™s your argument
 MS
 KRUGER: I mean, I think that that certainly reinforces the conclusion that I think also 
arises from other aspects of the provision, that what 
Congress had in mind wasn™t the imposition of a 
brandnew sentence, but simply a discretionary reduction  
Official of the old one
 I think that's right, Justice Kennedy
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I™m troubled by your response to Justice Kennedy's previous question, 
that the judge can take into account conduct in prison 
and all these other things
 It does seem to open it up to other factors than the crack cocaine disparity, and 
once you™re looking at other factors, why not look at 
everything? MS
 KRUGER: Well, I think the answer to that question is resolved by looking at the plain text 
of (c)(), Mr
 Chief Justice, which directs that 
district courts have a discretion to reduce sentences in 
a manner that™s consistent with applicable policy 
statements, but after considering these statutory 
sentencing factors under section (a), which 
include, of course, the need to protect the public from 
future crimes committed by the defendant, as well as the 
history and characteristics of the prisoner
 The reference to (a) guides district courts' discretion in deciding whether or not to grant a 
reduction that's authorized by the Sentencing Commission 
in the course of its statutory duty under (u) to 
specify whether and to what extent its amendments 
justify retroactive application
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, it's a one-way ratchet?  
Official MS
 KRUGER: Effectively
 I mean, it works in both directions
 It can justify granting a reduction; in the case of Petitioner, the district court 
thought that the (a) factors clearly pointed in 
favor of granting the reduction
 But it also -- those factors can work in the direction of denying an 
otherwise available reduction
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Petitioner's brief opens with a statement about his rehabilitation
 We don't know if that has been contested
 You don't respond to it
 But let's assume that's all true
 He established schools, and he helped young people and so 
forth
 Does the Justice Department ever make recommendations that prisoners like this have their 
sentence commuted? MS
 KRUGER: I am not aware of the answer to that, Justice Kennedy
 It is certainly true that evidence of that type of rehabilitation factored into 
the government's recommendation in this case that 
Petitioner --JUSTICE KENNEDY: And isn't the population of prisoners in the Federal prisons about , now? MS
 KRUGER: I think --JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think it is
 And were 
Official there -- how many commutations last year? None
 How many commutations the year before? Five
 Does this show that something is not working in the system? , prisoners? I think that™s the number
 MS
 KRUGER: I -- I'm not prepared to speak to that question today, Justice Kennedy
 I can tell you that the government very much takes those considerations 
into account when making recommendations about available 
sentence reductions under section (c)()
 And, indeed, in this case, the government agreed that the Petitioner should receive the full 
measure of the benefit that the Sentencing Commission 
had made available when it decided to make the crack 
cocaine amendments retroactive, based in large part on 
Petitioner's conduct in prison and his other 
characteristics
 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? Accepting the point that there™s no constitutional 
compulsion that they had to open up for a full new 
sentencing, and I understand one reason for not doing it 
is that you don't impose too much work on the district 
courts for doing it, but could you explain to me why 
as -- just as a matter of policy and good judgment, the 
Commission would say, well, you can take a look at all  
Official the negative factors that would argue against reduction, 
but you cannot look at any of the factors that would show 
why you should have had the same sentence that if -- why 
you should get the kind of sentence you would have 
gotten if you had been sentenced in the first place 
today? Because I guess this particular man is going to be -- spend  more years in jail than if he 
-- if he had been sentenced today
 MS
 KRUGER: The reason why the Commission doesn't do that is because it wouldn't comply with its 
statutory mandate under  U
S
C
 (u) to specify both 
which guidelines amendments justify retroactive 
application and the amount by which sentences may be 
reduced
 The Sentencing Commission would have no power to simply say in its policy statement: District courts, you are free to reduce sentences by however 
much amount you believe is appropriate
 JUSTICE STEVENS: You think the statute would have prohibited a more generous policy statement, 
then? MS
 KRUGER: I do think the statute would have prohibited such a policy statement
 Yes, that's correct, Justice Stevens
  
Official JUSTICE SCALIA: But I -- I still don't understand how you fit into that your answer to the 
Chief Justice earlier that, in fact, the court can 
consider other factors in -- in  when it's making 
the reduction
 MS
 KRUGER: Justice Scalia, I think the answer is simply that the (a) factors and their 
consideration under (c)() is designed for a 
different purpose than for the consideration that goes 
into the initial imposition of the sentence
 The point of considering the (a) factors, to the extent they are applicable, to use the 
words of (c)() --JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes
 MS
 KRUGER: -- is just to determine whether or not the district court will grant a reduction that is 
authorized, to the extent it is authorized, by applicable 
policy statements
 It™s not to determine whether the resulting sentence, as an original matter, is greater 
than necessary to comport with the statutory sentencing 
factors
 It's simply for the limited purpose of deciding whether to exercise discretion to reduce the 
sentence in a manner that™s authorized by the statute
 JUSTICE SCALIA: I see
 But -- but I thought you said you could take into account good 
Official behavior in that determination? But that isn't --that isn't a factor that would cause you to disallow 
the reduction
 It's a factor that --MS
 KRUGER: It's a factor that would cause you to permit the reduction, presumably
 It's one of the many considerations that a district court can take 
into account in deciding that it will, in fact, exercise 
its discretion to reduce the sentence to the extent that 
that™s permitted by Congress and applicable policy 
statements
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it -- it's also a factor that would -- might guide the district court to 
a decision not to reduce the sentence
 MS
 KRUGER: That's correct
 It can point in either direction in any given case
 But the critical point is that Congress has set the parameters for the district court's exercise of 
discretion in these proceedings
 Whatever the district court chooses to do has to be consistent with applicable 
policy statements, including the Commission's policy 
statement in which it™s implemented its statutory 
authority to specify whether and to what extent its 
guidelines amendments will justify retroactive 
application
 If the Court has no further questions, we
