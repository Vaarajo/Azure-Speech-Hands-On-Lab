speech17.wav	asset, why can't that reflect on, be about, your overall financial condition It's I own a genuine Vermeer I think, I mean, I'll give two answers to that. One, my first answer is, if it's a statement about a single asset, it's just not a statement about overall Ever? financial condition. Categorically? Categorically. If I said I win All right. Let's say I don't You know, people who win the lottery Let's say I don't accept that the lottery go broke too. Yeah. So that -- that's my first answer. What's your second answer? And my second answer is the one I gave to Justice Alito, which is that if one -- if the Court rejected the first answer, one could say that you'd look to whether a reasonable person in context would view the statement as being about one's overall financial situation. But it depends on context, doesn't it? It would The bank says, Schmidt, you are broke. Are you kidding, says Schmidt, I have a genuine Vermeer
speech18.wav	Right I mean, and, oh, oh, I didn't know that, says the teller. Here's $100,000. I mean, what -- what -- you know, what's that if it's not about overall financial? And that would be a hypothetical that I think would call into play this -- this separate rule, if the Court wantedto go there. Now you couldn't say that about the statement in this case. No reasonable person would look in the context here and say that the statement that I have a $100,000 tax Why isn't it exactly like the genuine Vermeer? All right? The law firm's chasing the client and -- and the client says: Okay, okay, okay, I'm late in paying, I know I'm terribly late in paying, but I have this tax refund coming. I have the genuine Vermeer almost in my possession. Right? Yes. I think Why isn't that -why -- why isn't everyone in the room understanding exactly what that means
speech19.wav	which is, okay, I don't have a lot else, but I've got this. I think -- I think it'sthe difference between "financial condition" and "ability to pay," which are two different concepts, and Congress said "financial condition." Well -- well, that -- that's a problem for me too, and maybe you can help me out with that, is the insolvency definitions in --- in the tax code, at least for municipalities Right "financial condition" is defined as the ability to meet your current debts as they come due. That -- that's not the way Congress thought of it. If you look at the definition of insolvency, it refers to "financial condition" first, and the difference between assets and liabilities. Congress also differentiated between assets and liabilities and financial conditions in other provisions, where it listed those terms separately in 11 U.S.C. 1103 c 2 and 1106 a 3. And -- and there's two different -two addi
speech20.wav	reasons why I don't think you could read "respecting" in the broad "related to" way that Respondent and the government ask you to here.The second -- the first one is that it strips "financial condition" of meaning. The second one is that Congress used the term "related to" in nearby provisions of the statute, in both 1926 and 1978, showing that when Congress meant "relating to," the broadest conceivable definition, it said "relating to." Not "respecting." And  the third reason is just the consequences of Respondent's and the government's rule. Their rule would render the baseline rule in Section 523, that debts procured by fraud are not dischargeable, inapplicable to a common fact pattern under Section 523, which is statements made about one's finances
speech21.wav	to secure credit Now the government itself on page 18 of its brief recognizes that that is a common situation, someone making statements about one's finances to -- to obtain credit. And yet the consequence of Respondent's and -- and the government's rule is to wipe that out as a basis for discharge And there's -- there's no indication at all that Congress in mind -- that Congress had in mind such a dramatic reshifting of the ordinary regime that it has applied for a century in this context, which is a debt procured by fraud is not dischargeable. And this Court relied upon similar considerations, for example, in Maracich versus Spears, where it refused to interpret an exception to the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, in
speech22.wav	a broad manner that it would really strike at the heart of the overlying objective there. And, here, we have a textually grounded objective, that this Court has recognized repeatedly, of not releasing, for debtors, debts procured by fraud. And I think one would look skeptically to a rule that would wipe out the application of that age-old rule in a commonly recurring context, which is statements made about finances. And that's May I -- may I ask you to clarify something? I -- I may not have understood this correctly. But the statement "don't worry, I am above water" Yeah I think you said that would need to be in writing. It would. And I think that the -- the fairest way to read that would be a statement about financial condition. And that's quite different than a statement about an individual asset. That fact pattern
speech23.wav	is not coming up in the real world, Justice Ginsburg. No reasonable creditor would rely on a statement that general, but, in our view, that is a statement respecting financial condition that - How is -- how is that significantly different from "don't worry, I have an anticipated tax refund that will enable me to pay your bill"? Right. Because that -that's -- that goes to ability to pay, not overall financial condition. And, again -- and it goes to why we ask for collateral in loans commonly. Well, but Mr. Collateral is not a I'm sorry. I was going to say, I mean, you -- it's not uncommon for people to have -- be in dire financial straits but yet go to get loans on the basis of collateral. That's sort of the pay day situation that the government refers to. "Ability to pay" is a different concept than "financial condition." Congress would have known that. At the time it enacted the "financial condition" lang
